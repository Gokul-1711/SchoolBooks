A Shirt in
the Market
This chapter tells us the story
of a shirt ! It begins with the
production of cotton and ends
with the sale of the shirt. We
shall see that a chain of
markets links the producer of
cotton to the buyer of the
shirt in the supermarket.
Buying and selling takes place
at every step in the chain.
Does everyone benefit equally
from this? Or do some people
benefit more than others? We
shall find out.

CHAPTER



A cotton farmer in Kurnool Did Swapna get a fair price on the
cotton?

Swapna, a small farmer in Kurnool (Andhra Pradesh)
grows cotton on her small piece of land. The bolls of Why did the trader pay Swapna

which carry the cotton in them, do not burst open Where do you think large farmers
all at once so it takes several days to harvest the would sell their cotton? How is
cotton. their situation different from

Swapna?
Once the cotton is collected, instead of selling it at

Kurnool cotton market, Swapna and her husband
take the harvest to the local trader. At the beginning
of the cropping season, Swapna had borrowed
` 2,500 from the trader at a very high interest rate
to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides for cultivation.
At that time, the local trader made Swapna agree to
another condition. He made her promise to sell all
her cotton to him.

Cultivation of cotton requires high levels of inputs
such as fertilisers and pesticides and the farmers
have to incur heavy expenses on account of these.
Most often, the small farmers need to borrow money
to meet these expenses.

At the traders yard, two of his men weigh the
bags of cotton. At a price of ` 1,500 per quintal, the
cotton fetches ` 6,000. The trader deducts
` 3,000 for repayment of loan and interest and pays
Swapna ̀  3,000.

Swapna: ` 3,000 only!

Trader: Cotton is selling cheap. There is a lot of
cotton in the market.

Swapna: I have toiled so hard for four months to
grow this cotton. You can see how fine and clean the
cotton is this time. I had hoped to get a much better
price.

Chapter 8: A Shirt in the Market 87



Trader: Amma, I am giving you a good price. Other
traders are not even paying this much. You can check
at the Kurnool market, if you do not believe me.

Swapna: Dont be angry. How can I doubt you? I had
only hoped that we would earn enough from the
cotton crop to last us a few months.

Though Swapna knows that cotton will sell for at
least ` 1,800 per quintal, she doesnt argue further.
The trader is a powerful man in the village and the
farmers have to depend on him for loans not only for
cultivation, but also to meet other exigencies such
as illnesses, childrens school fees. Also, there are
times in the year when there is no work and no
income for the farmers, so borrowing money is the
only means of survival.

Swapnas earning from cotton cultivation is barely
more than what she might have earned as a wage
labourer.

The cloth market of Erode

Erodes bi-weekly cloth market in Tamil Nadu is one
of the largest cloth markets in the world. A large
variety of cloth is sold in this market. Cloth that is
made by weavers in the villages around is also
brought here for sale. Around the market are offices
of cloth merchants who buy this cloth. Other traders
from many south Indian towns also come and
purchase cloth in this market.

 On market days, you would also find weavers
bringing cloth that has been made on order from the
merchant. These merchants supply cloth on order
to garment manufacturers and exporters around the
country. They purchase the yarn and give
instructions to the weavers about the kind of cloth

see how this is done.

whereby the merchant supplies the raw material and
receives the finished product. It is prevalent in the
weaving industry in most regions of India.

Weavers cooperative

We have seen that the weavers are paid very little by the
merchant under the putting out system. Weavers cooperatives
are one way to reduce the dependence on the merchant and to
earn a higher income for the weavers.  In a cooperative, people
with common interests come together and work for their mutual
benefit. In a weavers cooperative, the weavers form a group and
take up certain activities collectively. They procure yarn from
the yarn dealer and distribute it among the weavers. The
cooperative also does the marketing. So, the role of the merchant
is reduced, and weavers get a fair price on the cloth.

At times, the government helps the cooperatives by buying cloth from them at a reasonable
price. For instance, the Tamil Nadu government runs a Free School Uniform programme in
the state. The government procures the cloth for this programme from the powerloom weavers
cooperatives.  Similarly, the government buys cloth from the handloom weavers cooperatives
and sells it through stores known as Co-optex. You might have come across one of these
stores in your town.

The poor have to depend on the rich and the powerful
for various things. They have to depend for loans (as
in the case of Swapna, the small farmer), for raw
materials and marketing of their goods (weavers in
the putting out system), and most often for
employment (workers at the garment factory).
Because of this dependence, the poor are exploited
in the market. There are ways to overcome these such
as forming cooperatives of producers and ensuring
that laws are followed strictly.
