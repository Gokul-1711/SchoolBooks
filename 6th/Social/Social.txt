Introduction – Why Social Science?



LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Observe the picture above. What do you notice?

 Where does the water in the lake come from?
 Who made the road and why?
 What could be the activities of people living in  

the small house? What could be their history?  
Their future?

Æ Write down your answers and discuss them with your 
classmates.

Æ Now, looking at the picture on the facing page, what 
questions come to your mind? Write them down. 

Æ How do you propose to find answers to the questions 
related to these two images?

How are our questions above relevant to Social Science?
We live in the 21st century (if you do not know what this figure 
really means, you will soon learn about it). Everyone agrees 
that it is a particularly challenging time for humanity. On

the one hand, there is rapid progress in technology, which 
is changing our lives in many ways. On the other hand, the 
world is witnessing multiple wars, armed conflicts and 
rising social tensions, and our planet’s natural environment 
is under great stress. We live in an age of great possibilities 
but also great challenges.
The world over, more and more people wonder, “How do we 
solve the problems facing humanity? How can our societies 
learn to live in peace and harmony? How can we protect 
this beautiful Earth which we all share — and protect it not 
only for ourselves but also for all the species that live on it?”
These fundamental questions are simple, but the answers 
are not. They cannot be simple, because human societies 
are very diverse and complex. If we wish to find answers to 
such questions and help build a better future, we first need 
to understand our world, and human societies in particular. 
That is what Social Science is all about.
You may wonder whether this is a ‘science’ like, say, physics 
or chemistry. It is not. The discipline does use scientific

Introduction – Why Social Science?



methods wherever possible (you will see a few examples 
in this textbook), but its focus — human society — is, again, 
too diverse to allow the kind of set procedures and fixed 
results the sciences come up with.  
Social Science has many subdisciplines: geography, history, 
political science, economics, sociology, anthropology, 
archaeology, psychology and a few more. You need not feel 
intimidated by all these terms! While you will study some of 
these subdisciplines in the Secondary Stage, in the Middle 
Stage we have avoided this classification. Instead, we have 
opted for five broad themes. Let us briefly look at them. 
(Note that the mind map at the start of this Introduction 
includes chapters of both parts of this textbook.)
Theme A – India and the World:  
Land and the People
This first theme includes the basics of the geographical 
world around us — some of the main features of our planet 
and the way to represent them on a map. Why is this 
theme important, when today we can get excellent maps 
on a mobile phone? Because it deals with much more than 
maps. It also asks how geographical features — oceans, 
mountains, rivers, etc. — have shaped entire civilisations 
throughout their histories. It is also, in India’s case, about 
how its natural setting has contributed to giving this ancient 
civilisation a unique identity.
Theme B – Tapestry of the Past
A tapestry is a large piece of canvas-like cloth usually 
kept as a wall hanging, with pictures and designs on it — 
sometimes a historical narrative. Our tapestry is where 
we will be painting scenes from the past, beginning with 
India’s past. But why should we be at all concerned with the 
past? Because it is the key to understanding the present, and 
the chapters in this theme will often make this connection 

4

Exploring Society: India and Beyond



clear. The past is a major source for our identities — it 
helps us understand who we are and where we come from. 
The past is still with us, in other words. And since history is 
unfortunately not all about happy developments, it is useful 
to understand where people, governments or rulers went 
wrong, and why. Only then can we hope to avoid repeating 
those errors. 
Theme C – Our Cultural Heritage and 
Knowledge Traditions
It has often been said that India has a rich and ancient 
culture. True, but what are its main characteristics? Its 
guiding principles? How has it manifested itself in India’s 
history? And how can it help us to deal with issues of our 
times? These are some of the questions that this theme is 
exploring, with the objective that every student should 
understand some of the cultural foundations of our 
civilization and learn to appreciate their value.
Theme D – Governance and Democracy
Citizens of any country should know how their political 
system functions. India, as the world’s largest democracy, 
has an elaborate system working at different levels. What 
are its chief characteristics and components? How do the 
citizens participate in the overall governance? What are 
their rights and also their duties or dharma? Are there 
different systems in other countries, and, if so, of what 
type? How are different countries supposed to interact? 
By studying this theme, we can become more responsible 
citizens, understand how the organs of the government 
function, and learn to have a say in the policies that affect 
us all, whether locally or nationally.
Theme E – Economic Life Around Us
No family can be happy without the essentials of daily 
living — at least food, clothing, shelter, access to water in a 

5

first stage; in a second, livelihood for adults and access to 
education for the younger ones. Similarly, no country can 
develop harmoniously without a sound economy. But how 
does an economy work, especially in a huge country like 
India? What exactly is money? Where does it come from? 
How can it be increased? What economic activities can 
people engage themselves in? How are natural and human 
resources best managed? This theme will lay down some of 
the important concepts and practices that will enable us to 
answer these questions.

  

You will notice that there are many questions in the 
preceding paragraphs. This is as it should be — Social 
Science is also about the art of asking the right questions. 
Only then can we start looking for the right answers. This 
also explains the presence of ‘Big Questions’ at the start of 
each chapter in this book.
You may also be intrigued to find a game of chess and 
some ancient Tamil poetry in chapters that apparently deal 
with geography; a discussion on the uses of the sari in a 
chapter on cultural heritage; the concept of sevā and the 
mention of festivals in chapters focusing on economics. 
This is deliberate. We believe in bringing elements from 
diverse fields together (you will learn later that this is 
called ‘multidisciplinarity’). This enriches our perspective. 
Indeed, life constantly mixes numerous elements together, 
so why should we not?
By now, it should be clear that although Social Science 
makes constant use of the past, it seeks to make sense of 
the present so as to help us prepare a better future. It is an 
exploration and an adventure.

CHAPTER

1 – Locating Places on the Earth



Imagine that you are visiting a city for the first time. How 
would you find the places you want to visit? You might ask 
a local person for help, or you might look at a map of the 
city. In previous grades, you learnt a little about maps, and 
in this chapter, we will study them in more detail. 
Let us play a game. Examine the map of this small city 
(Fig. 1.1). Imagine that you just got off a train at the railway 
station, and you want to visit the bank marked on the 
map. Which way would you go? Are there other possible 
ways? Can you locate the public garden, the school and 
the museum? If you want to proceed from the bank to the 
market, which way will you go? This is where a map comes 
in handy!

Fig. 1.1. A map of an imaginary small city.

A map is like a treasure guide; it shows you where things 
are and how to get to them. Notice the four arrows in the top 
right corner of the map; we will soon see how they point to 

8 some specific directions and make maps even more helpful.

India and the World: Land and the People



LET’S EXPLORE
Æ On the map in Fig. 1.1 given on page 8 —

1. Mark the hospital. 
2. What is the meaning of the blue-coloured areas?
3. Which is farther away from the railway station — 

the school, the Nagar Panchayat or the public garden?
Æ As a class activity, form groups of three or four students 

each. Let each group try to draw a map of your school 
and some of the streets or roads that lead to it, and a few 
neighbouring buildings. At the end, compare all the maps 
and discuss.

A Map and Its Components
From this simple example, we understand that a map is a 
representation, or a drawing, of some area — it may be a 
small area (a village, a town, etc.), a bigger area (say, your 
district or state), or a very large area like India or even the 
whole world. In a map, you look at the surface as if you are 
viewing it from the top.
An atlas is a book or collection of maps.
As you will discover, there are several kinds of maps —
 physical maps, which mainly show some natural 

features such as mountains, oceans and rivers (see an 
example in Fig. 5.2 in this textbook)

 political maps, which show details of countries or 
states, boundaries, cities, etc. (for instance, a map of 
India with all its States, Union Territories and their 
capitals)

 thematic maps, with a specific kind of information 
(examples include Fig. 6.3 and Fig. 8.1 in this textbook).

In addition, there are three important components of 
maps—distance, direction and symbols. You have already 

9

1-100724-v9.indd   9 11-Jul-24   4:20:20 PM

experienced the first two while navigating the map in Fig. 
1.1. Let us now define them more precisely.
Have you ever wondered how a huge place can fit on a small 
piece of paper? It is all thanks to the map’s scale. Let us go 
back to our map of a small city (Fig. 1.1). Each centimetre 
on the map, as printed here, represents a certain distance 
on the ground — let us suppose it is 500 metres; we say that 
the scale is 1 cm = 500 m. Now, turn to the map of India in 
Fig. 5.2 in Chapter 5 of this textbook. The scale is repre-
sented in the bottom left corner by a ruler with ‘500’ written 
above its length and ‘km’ on the side. It simply means that 
this ruler, which measures 2.5 cm in the printed map, 
corresponds to 500 kilometres on the ground.   
So, the actual distance between two points represented on 
the map depends on the scale that the map is using.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Draw a simple map of a school’s playground. Let us 

assume it is a rectangle, 40 m in length and 30 m in width. 
Draw it precisely with your ruler on a scale of 1 cm = 10 m.

Æ Now measure the diagonal of the rectangle. How many 
centimetres do you get? Using the scale, calculate the real 
length of the playground’s diagonal, in metres.

Let us return to the four arrows at the top right 
of the small city’s map. They point to four 

directions, which are north, at the top, and, 
North moving clockwise, east, south and west. 

Northwest Northeast These are called the cardinal directions, 
also cardinal points. Other than these, 

West East intermediate directions are also used — 
northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest 

Southwest Southeast (SW) and northwest (NW). Most maps 
South simply have an arrow marked with the 

10 letter ‘N’, which points to the north direction. 

1-100724-v9.indd   10 11-Jul-24   4:20:21 PM

India and the World: Land and the People



LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Consider the map of the small city again. Identify the 

correct and incorrect statements in the list below:
1. The market is north of the hospital.
2. The museum is southeast of the bank.
3. The railway station is northwest of the hospital.
4. The lake is northwest of the apartment blocks.

Æ Taking your school as the starting point, do you know 
approximately in which cardinal direction your home is 
located? Discuss with your teacher and your parents.

Symbols are another important component of maps. Our 
map has small drawings of actual buildings and a few 
other elements, but there would not be enough space on the 
map of a large city or a country to draw them all. Instead, 
a symbol is used to represent these features — symbols for 
different kinds of buildings (for instance a railway station, 
a school, a post office), for roads and railway lines, and for 
natural elements such as a river, a pond or a forest. In that 
way, numerous details can be shown in the limited space 
available on a map.
To make maps more easily understood by a variety of users, 
map makers use specific symbols. Different countries use 
different sets of symbols. The Survey of India, a government 
body, has fixed a set of symbols for maps of India (or parts 
of India). A small selection of them is shown in Fig. 1.2 on 
page 12.

 LET’S EXPLORE
Draw a rough map of your locality or your village, including 
your home, school and a few other important landmarks. Show 
the cardinal directions and use a few of the symbols shown in 
Fig. 1.2 on page 12 to mark some important features.

Mapping the Earth
Mapping the Earth is a little more difficult because our 
planet is not a flat surface. It nearly has the shape of a 
sphere. (We say ‘nearly’ because it is not a perfect sphere, 
but is slightly flattened at the poles. However, in practice, 
we will consider it to be spherical.) Representing a sphere 
accurately on a flat sheet of paper is not possible. To 
understand why, peel an orange in such a way that you 
have just three or four large pieces of the skin; then try and 
flatten them on a table — you will see that you cannot do it 
without tearing them at the edges.
Now, consider a globe, which is a sphere on which a map 
is drawn. This may be a map of the Earth, the Moon, the 
planet Mars, the stars and constellations in the sky, etc. 
The physical object, like the one shown in the drawing on 
the next page, is a sphere that is generally made of metal, 

12 plastic or cardboard. 

1-100724-v9.indd   12 11-Jul-24   4:20:22 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond  
India and the World: Land and the People



Here we will study the globe representing 
the Earth’s geography. Because the globe 
and the Earth have the same spherical 
shape, a globe will better represent the 
geography of the Earth than a flat map. 
Let us now explore some of its features.

a) Understanding coordinates
Imagine a big market in a city or town, with 
neat rows of shops, all the same size. You 
want to meet a friend at a stationery shop 
inside the market. But your friend does 
not know where the shop is. So you would give directions 
like, “Meet me at 6 pm at the 7th shop in the 5th row from 
the entrance.” This will allow your friend to precisely 
determine your location. 
Now, consider a chessboard. 
To record moves by advanced 
players, letters are placed 
alongside the main pieces 
(from ‘a’ to ‘h’, see the image) 
and numbers (from 1 to 8) in 
between the two sides. This 
simple system allows players 
to mark each square and 
record every move. Here, the 
white side has just opened the 
game by moving the queen’s 
pawn two squares forward (a 
very common opening). So, 
the pawn is said to have moved from d2 to d4.

LET’S EXPLORE 
Using the same terms, write down your move if you play black 
and respond with the same move. 13

1-100724-v9.indd   13 11-Jul-24   4:20:23 PM

1 – Locating Places on the Earth



The system used in these two examples may be called a 
system of coordinates. Thanks to their two coordinates, 
the stationery shop as well as the chess square on the 
chessboard can be precisely determined.
A similar system of coordinates is used in the world of maps 
to determine the location of any place on a map. Let us see 
how this system works.

b) Latitudes
Let us return to the globe. It is easy to identify the North 
Pole and the South Pole on it. Rotate the globe; while it 
rotates, the fixed points at the top and bottom are the two 
poles. Halfway between them is the Equator; note the circle 
marking it (see Fig. 1.3). 
Imagine that you stand on the Equator and travel towards 
one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases. 
Latitude measures this distance from the Equator. At any 
point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that 
runs east and west, parallel to the Equator. Such a line is 
called a parallel of latitude and it draws a circle around 
the Earth. Again, it is easy to note on the globe that the 
largest circle is the Equator, while the circles marked by the 
parallels of latitude grow smaller as we move northward or 
southward (Fig. 1.3). 
Latitudes are expressed in degrees; by convention, the 
Equator is latitude 0° (zero degree), while the latitudes of 
the two poles are 90° North and 90° South respectively; this 
is noted 90°N and 90°S.
There is a connection between latitude and climate. Around 
the Equator, the climate is generally hot (it is also called 
‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one 
of the two poles (in other words, as your latitude increases), 
the climate becomes more moderate (or ‘temperate’). And 
closer to the North or South Pole, the climate grows colder 

14 (or ‘frigid’). You will learn in Science why this is so, and 

1-100724-v9.indd   14 11-Jul-24   4:20:23 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond  
India and the World: Land and the People



also why we experience different seasons in the course of 
a year.

 Fig. 1.3. This globe shows both parallels of latitude and  
meridians of longitudes 

c) Longitudes
Imagine now that you travel from the North Pole to the South 
Pole by the shortest possible line. Observe the globe: you 
will see that instead of passing through Europe and Africa, 
you could just as well pass through Asia — the distance 
would be the same. These lines are called meridians of 
longitude (Fig. 1.3). They are all half-circles running from 
one pole to the other.
You will also learn in Science that the Earth spins on its 
axis. To put it simply, let’s place a desk lamp a little away 
from our globe, focused on it, and imagine that this is 

15

1-100724-v9.indd   15 11-Jul-24   4:20:23 PM

1 – Locating Places on the Earth



the Sun illuminating the Earth. Slowly rotating the globe 
eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it 
is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night 
— when it’s breakfast time in one country, it’s lunchtime in 
another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That 
is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also 
be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how. 
To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point 
called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also 
called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884, 
some nations decided that the meridian passing through 
Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become 
the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is 
marked as 0° longitude. 
Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the 
Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is 
a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you 
travel along the Equator. Longitude, too, is measured in 
degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from 
0° to 180°, with the letter ‘W’ or ‘E’ added. For instance, 
using round figures, New York’s longitude is 74°W, while 
Delhi’s is 77°E and Tokyo’s is 140°E.

DON’T MISS OUT
As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180°W 
and 180°E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 
180°, omitting the letter W or E. 

Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of 
a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on 
Earth! You can now understand a statement such as “Delhi 
lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude” (these values are 
rounded off, not exact).
Fig. 1.3 on page 15 shows the parallels of latitude and the 

16 meridians of longitude together on the globe as blue lines. 

1-100724-v9.indd   16 11-Jul-24   4:20:23 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond  
India and the World: Land and the People



All these lines together constitute a grid for the globe; they 
are also called grid lines.

LET’S EXPLORE 
If the globe or atlas in your class has well-marked latitudes 
and longitudes, try to note down approximate values for the 
latitude and longitude of (1) Mumbai, (2) Kolkata, (3) Singapore, 
(4) Paris.

Fig. 1.4. This sketch shows how the Prime Meridian divides the Earth into 
the Western and Eastern Hemispheres, while the Equator divides it into the 

Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 

    DON’T MISS OUT
The Greenwich Meridian is not the first prime meridian. 
There were others in the past. In fact, many centuries before 
Europe, India had a prime meridian of its own! (Fig. 1.5) It 
was called madhya rekhā (or ‘middle line’) and passed through 
the city of Ujjayinī (today Ujjain), which was a reputed centre 
for astronomy over many centuries. Varāhamihira, a famous 
astronomer, lived and worked there some 1,500 years ago.
Indian astronomers were aware of concepts of latitude and 
longitude, including the need for a zero or prime meridian. 
The Ujjayinī meridian became a reference for calculations in 
all Indian astronomical texts. 

17

1-100724-v9.indd   17 11-Jul-24   4:20:23 PM

The map shows a few ancient Indian cities close to the Ujjayinī 
meridian. Some are very close to it, while others are a little 
away. That is because measuring longitude required accurate 
timekeeping, which was not as precise then as it is today.

Understanding Time Zones
Let’s make the globe rotate again from west to east — 
that is how our planet spins around its axis, making a full 
turn every 24 hours. A full turn is 360°, so this means 15° 
per hour (15 x 24 = 360). Let us now mark the meridians 
of longitude every 15°. Moving eastward from the Prime 
Meridian, we get 0°, 15°E, 30°E, 45°E, and so on every 15° 
up to 180°E. It is the same as adding one hour of local time 
with each meridian — if it is 12 pm or noon at Greenwich, it 
is 1 pm local time at 15°E, 2 pm at 30°E, and so on. But going 
westward, it is the other way round — 11 am local time at 
15°W, 10 am at 30°W, etc.

LET’S EXPLORE 
Two friends, one sitting in Porbandar (Gujarat) and the other 
in Tinsukia (Assam), are speaking on the phone late afternoon. 
The latter remarks that the sun has set in Assam and it’s 
now dark. The former is surprised and says, “But it’s still full 
daylight here!” Explain why. And, as a class activity, calculate 
the difference in local time between those two cities. (Hint: for 
now, consider the difference in longitude between Porbandar 
and Tinsukia to be 30°; later, you can find out the precise value.)

The same method can be used to calculate the local time 
of any place on the Earth. But it would not be convenient 
for a country to use many local times! That is why most 
countries adopt a standard time based on a meridian 
passing through them. Indian Standard Time (IST) is 5 
hours 30 minutes (also noted 5.5 hours) ahead of the local 
time at Greenwich (called Greenwich Mean Time or GMT).

LET’S EXPLORE
Return to the two friends sitting in Gujarat and Assam. Use 
this example to explain the difference between local time and 
standard time. 

All these standard times are organized in time zones, which 
broadly follow the zones of 15° in the graph (Fig. 1.7). But let 
us consider the world map below (Fig. 1.8). We can see that 
the lines dividing the time zones are not fully straight. This 
is because they have to respect each country’s standard time 
and, therefore, tend to follow international borders. The 
numbers written inside some countries are the numbers of 
hours to be added to GMT to get their standard times if they 
have a positive sign, or subtracted from GMT if they have a 
negative sign.

Fig. 1.8. A world map of the time zones, showing the standard times (with 
respect to GMT) for a few countries. (Note that international borders are 

approximate, not exact.)

DON’T MISS OUT 
From the above explanation, it may seem as if every country 
has one standard time. That is not always the case. Some 
countries, like Russia, Canada or the USA, are too large to have 
a single time zone. The USA has six time zones and Russia has 
11 — which means that travelling across Russia from east to 
west, you will need to readjust your watch 10 times to align 
with the local time!

Similarly, the globe in Fig. 1.9, centred on India, shows 
standard times with respect to GMT for a few countries. 
Finally, while the Prime Meridian was fixed at Greenwich, 
the opposite line — at approximately 180° longitude — is 
called the International Date Line. 
As you can see on the map, the +12 and the –12 time zones 
touch each other at this line. If you cross it by ship or plane, 

22 you need to change the date in your watch. If you cross it

travelling eastward, you subtract a day (say, from Monday 
to Sunday); if you cross it travelling westward, you add a day 
(from Sunday to Monday). We said that the International 
Date Line is ‘approximately’ at 180° longitude, as it deviates 
in places to avoid dividing some countries into two different 
days!

Before we move on ...
Æ Maps are a very useful tool to represent an area of the Earth, 

whether small or large. The main components of maps are 
distance, direction and symbols.

Æ Every place on the Earth has a location which can be 
precisely defined with the help of a grid of latitudes and 
longitudes — imaginary lines running from east to west 
(parallel to the Equator) and north to south (from pole to 
pole) respectively. 23

Oceans and Continents 2
The ocean is everything. It covers seven-tenths of the 
terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an 
immense desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life 
stirring all around. ... The ocean is the vast reservoir of 
Nature. The globe began with the ocean, so to speak, and 
who knows if it will not end with it. …

— Jules Verne (1870)

The Big 
Questions

1. What are oceans 
and continents? 
What are their 
names and their 
distribution?

2. In what ways 
do oceans and 
continents 
impact life on 
Earth, including 
human life?

CHAPTER

2 – Oceans and Continents



Let us return to our globe and rotate it gently. Or look at 
the picture of the Earth seen from the Moon. What is the 
most widespread colour you see? Blue, obviously, but what 
does it represent? You must have guessed the answer — it 
is ‘water’. This means that most of the Earth’s surface is 
actually covered with water — almost three-fourths of the 
surface, in fact. That is why, when seen from outer space, 
the Earth appears mostly blue. Indeed, early astronauts 
lovingly called the Earth the ‘blue planet’.
The largest water bodies we see on the globe are called 
‘oceans’. 
But in the picture of the Earth (Fig. 2.1), you can see at least 
one other colour, brown. This colour is that of land, which 
covers a little over one-fourth of the globe. A large body of 
land is called a ‘landmass’, and a large continuous expanse 
of land is called a ‘continent’. 
Both oceans and continents play a vital role in shaping the 
climate of the Earth. They affect all aspects of life, including 
all plants and animals, and therefore, human life too. We 
see their impact throughout our history and culture, and in 
our daily lives.

The emblem of the Indian Navy 
contains the motto Sam noh Varunah

This is an invocation to Varuṇa, a Vedic 
deity associated with the oceans, the 
sky, and water in general.

The Distribution of Water and  
Land on the Earth
As it happens, oceans and continents are not distributed 
equally between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

The oceans together hold most of the water available on the 
planet. But this seawater is salty and unfit for consumption 
by most land animals, including humans. On the other 
hand, freshwater makes up a very small proportion of the 
planet’s water resources; it is found in glaciers, rivers, lakes, 
in the atmosphere and also underground (the last is called 
‘groundwater’).

THINK ABOUT IT
 If there is such abundance of water on the planet, why is 

there so much talk of ‘water scarcity’ or a ‘water crisis’?
 What ways of saving water are you aware of? Which 

ones have you seen practised at home, at your school, 
and in your village, town or city?

Oceans

 As the map of oceans makes clear, the main limits of the 

Indian Ocean are Asia to the north, Africa to the west and 
Australia to the east, apart from the Southern Ocean in the 
south.

 On either side of India, we find two parts of the Indian 
Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west and the Bay of Bengal 
to the east.

the same as Fig. 1.6, but with the addition of 
the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Also 

marked are India’s two major groups 
of islands (see subsection on ‘Islands’ 

further below).

Oceans and disasters
Returning to the picture of the 
Earth at the start of this chapter, 
you may have noticed white 
shapes across the globe. Did you 
guess what they are? They are 
large masses of clouds. Such clouds 
bring rain to the continents; for 
instance, the monsoon rains we 
in India expect every summer 
originate in the ocean — without 
such rains, our agriculture and all life will suffer. But oceans 
often also give rise to storms — violent events with extreme 
rainfall or very strong winds, such as cyclones, which can 
cause widespread damage to coastal regions of the world. 
A tsunami is another natural disaster that originates in the 
ocean. It is a huge and powerful wave generally caused by 
a strong earthquake or a volcanic eruption at the bottom 
of the ocean. Tsunamis can travel thousands of kilometres 
and submerge coastal areas, causing widespread damage. 33

2_100724_v7.indd   33 11-Jul-24   4:21:06 PM

2 – Oceans and Continents



 DON’T MISS OUT
 On 26 December 2004, India and another 13 countries 

around the Indian Ocean were struck by a powerful 
tsunami caused by an earthquake in Indonesia. More 
than two lakh people lost their lives. In India, the  
Andaman and Nicobar Islands (see Fig. 2.4 above, and 
also the subsection ‘Islands’ further below) and the 
coasts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala were severely affected 
and suffered much damage and loss of life.

 Such tsunamis are rare but very destructive. Luckily, 
they can often be detected before they hit a coast. Many 
countries collaborate in such ‘early warning systems’. 
There is, in particular, an Indian Ocean Tsunami 
Warning System, to which many countries, including 
India, contribute. This helps to take measures to protect 
lives and property.

 Events that lead to loss of life and property are handled 
under disaster management. India has its own  
‘National Disaster Management Authority’ to deal with 
all kinds of disasters (we will see more examples in the 
next chapter).

Continents
Continents are visible on the map of oceans (Fig. 2.3). How 
many can you count? The answer is not so simple, as they 
can be counted in several ways. Depending on our choice, 
we may list any number of continents between four and 
seven! Here is why:
 North America and South America are generally 

considered to be two continents; but if seen as a single 
landmass, they can also be considered as one.

 Europe and Asia are generally considered as two 
continents, although the map makes it clear that they 
form a single landmass. For historical and cultural 

34 reasons, Europe’s evolution has been very different 

2_100724_v7.indd   34 11-Jul-24   4:21:06 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond 
India and the World: Land and the People



from Asia’s, which is why they can be seen as two 
continents. Geologists, however, often regard them as 
a single continent called ‘Eurasia’. 

 Africa and Eurasia are generally regarded as two 
continents, but sometimes as one. 

Let us summarise the different counts in a table:

Count of continents (in alphabetical order)

Four continents Africa-Eurasia, America, Antarctica, Australia

Five continents Africa, America, Antarctica, Australia, Eurasia

Six continents Africa, Antarctica, Australia, Eurasia, North 
America, South America (this is reflected in  
Fig. 2.3 on page 32)

Seven continents Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North 
America, South America

In practice, the last list of seven continents is the one most 
widely adopted and used.

You may have seen the five Olympic 
rings, one of the symbols of the 
Olympic Games. They symbolise 
the gathering of sportspeople from 
all over the world. The rings were 
chosen to represent five inhabited 
continents — Africa, America, Asia, 
Australia and Europe. 

Now let us look at the diagram on page 36, which is based 
on the list of seven continents. It does not show their actual 
shapes, but their relative sizes.

the continents do not include all landmass. Some smaller 
pieces of land are left out; surrounded by water on all sides, 
they are called islands. (Continents are also surrounded 
by water, but because they are so large, they are not 
considered islands.) 
There are lakhs of islands on the planet, of very different 
sizes. 

 DON’T MISS OUT
 Greenland is the largest island in the world (locate it on a 

globe or a map). You would have to add the areas of the 10 
largest states of India to reach its size.

 India has more than 1,300 small islands! Those include 
two major groups — Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the 
Bay of Bengal and Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian Sea 
(see Fig. 2.4).

 Since 1981, the Indian Antarctica Programme has been 
exploring Antarctica, a continent with a very cold climate 
and harsh environment (see the white expanse at the 
bottom of Fig. 2.1, which is mostly ice). In 1983, India 
established its first scientific base station there, called 
‘Dakshin Gangotri’ (two more bases were established 
later). About 40 teams of Indian scientists have conducted 
research in this faraway region, especially on the evolution 
of climate and environment. The settlement where the 
scientists live has a library and even a post office!

Oceans and Life
Oceans and continents are vital parts of the environment 
and affect most aspects of our lives, even if we do not 
notice it. We have mentioned that oceans send rain to the 
continents; this is part of the Earth’s water cycle, which 
you will further study in Science. Without oceans, for

instance, there would be no rainfall! The Earth would be a 
desert. Moreover, more than half of the world’s oxygen is 
produced by the oceans’ flora, which is why they are called 
‘the planet’s lungs’. The oceans, therefore, play a crucial 
role in regulating the climate and sustaining life on Earth.
Oceans have deeply impacted humanity in many other 
ways. From early times, people have used oceans and seas 
to migrate to other regions, to trade in all kinds of goods, 
to conduct military campaigns, and as a source of food 
through fishing. Oceans have also nourished the cultures 
of coastal people all over the world. Almost all of them have 
tales and legends about the sea, sea gods and goddesses, sea 
monsters and treasures from the sea — the oceans’ dangers 
but also their blessings.

  DON’T MISS OUT
The United Nations has designated June 8 as World Oceans Day 
to “remind us all of the major role the ocean plays in everyday 
life. It serves as the lungs of our planet, a major source of 
food and medicine and a critical part of the biosphere.” 
Scientific studies have shown how the oceans are polluted 
by human activity — we throw several million tonnes of 
plastic waste into the oceans every year, choking marine life. 
There are several other forms of pollution. As a result, the 
marine environment is under threat. Overfishing (excessive 
fishing) is another cause for the decline of marine life. 
It is our collective responsibility to protect oceans for the future 
of the planet and of humanity.

Before we move on …
Æ The Earth’s surface has vast water bodies called ‘oceans’

CHAPTER

3 – Landforms and Life



Introduction
Humans, like most mammals, live on land. Land, as you may 
have noticed, has many forms and features; its appearance 
changes a lot from one region to another. Suppose that you 
are travelling by road from the region known as Chhota 
Nagpur in Jharkhand, reach Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, 
and go on to Almora in Uttarakhand. On the way, you will 
see very different landscapes. In fact, you will encounter 
three major landforms, which we will now explore.
LET’S EXPLORE
Æ As a class activity, form groups of four or five students 

and observe the school’s surroundings. What kind of 
landscape do you see? Will the landscape change a few 
kilometres away? Or within some 50 kilometres? Compare 
with other groups.

a variety of flora and fauna. Humans have adapted to all 
landforms, but the number of people living on different 
kinds of landforms varies throughout the world. 

Mountains 
Mountains are landforms that are much higher than the 
surrounding landscape. They can be recognised by a broad 
base, steep slopes and a narrow summit. Depending on 
their height, some mountains are covered with snow. At 
lower altitudes, the snow melts every summer and turns

snow! In the rest of India, most precipitation is in the form 
of rain and hail. But at higher altitudes, if it is cold enough,  
snow will fall, covering the landscape in a soft and beautiful 
white blanket. Snow and hailstones are nothing but 
precipitation of water in a solid state.

Fig. 3.2 shows pictures of six mountains of the world. 
Fig. 3.3 brings them together to give a visual impression of 
their relative heights from top to bottom. Mount Everest 
(between Tibet (China) and Nepal) and Kanchenjunga 
(between Nepal and the Indian state of Sikkim) are the two 
highest peaks of the Himalayan range. Mount Aconcagua 
(in South America) is the highest peak of the Andes. Mount 
Kilimanjaro in eastern Africa is an isolated mountain that 
is not part of any range. Mont Blanc in Western Europe 
is the highest mountain of the Alps. Anamudi (in Kerala, 
also known as ‘Anai Peak’) is the highest mountain in south 
India.

ancient India. The poem, Kumārasambhava, begins with an invocation 
to the Himalayas. (This is a simplified translation from the Sanskrit.)

‘Ganga’ is the Indian name of the largest river originating in  
the Himalayas. In English, ‘Ganges’ is also used. Nearly 2,500 km 
long, this river has numerous tributaries (that is, other rivers 
joining it). Some of them, like the Yamuna and the Ghagara, also 
originate in the Himalayas. Others, like the Son or Sone, originate 
from the Vindhya Range to the south of the Ganga plain.

Many traditional communities around the world consider 
mountains to be sacred places and worship them. Mount 
Everest, the highest mountain in the world at 8,849 m, has 
many names. Tibetans call it ‘Chomolungma’, which means 
‘Mother Goddess of the World’ and worship the mountain as 
such. Nepalis call it ‘Sagarmatha’, meaning ‘Goddess of the Sky’. 
Similarly, Mount Kailash in Tibet is held sacred by followers 
of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Bon (an ancient Tibetan 
religion). Such reverence for mountain summits is also found 
elsewhere in India, as well as in other parts of the world.

Plateaus
A plateau is a landform that rises up from the surrounding 
land and has a more or less flat surface; some of its sides 
are often steep slopes. Like mountains, plateaus can be 
young or old in terms of the Earth’s history. Two examples 
of plateaus are the Tibetan Plateau, the largest and highest 
plateau in the world, and the Deccan Plateau. The height 
of plateaus can vary from a few hundred metres to several 
thousand metres.

   DON’T MISS OUT
 The Tibetan Plateau has an average altitude of 4,500 m, 

which explains why it has been nicknamed the ‘Roof of 
the World’! From east to west, it is nearly 2,500 km long 
— the distance from Chandigarh to Kanyakumari.

 The Deccan Plateau of central and south India is one of 
the oldest plateaus in the world, formed through volcanic 
activity millions of years ago.

Like mountains, plateaus are rich in mineral deposits; they 
have been called ‘storehouses of minerals’. As a result, 
mining is a major activity on plateaus, where many of the 
world’s largest mines are found. For example, the East 51

3 – Landforms and Life



African Plateau is famous for gold and diamond mining. In 
India, huge reserves of iron, coal and manganese are found 
in the Chhota Nagpur Plateau. 
The plateau environment is very diverse across the world. 
Many plateaus have a rocky soil, which makes them less 
fertile than plains (see next section) and therefore less 
favourable to farming. An exception is that of lava plateaus 
(that is, formed through volcanic activity), as they often 
have a rich black soil.
Plateaus are also home to many spectacular waterfalls. 
The Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River in southern Africa, 
the Hundru Falls on the Subarnarekha River in the Chhota 
Nagpur Plateau and the Jog Falls on the Sharavati River in 
the Western Ghats are a few such waterfalls. The Nohkalikai 
Falls (Fig. 3.7) drop down 340 metres from the Cherrapunji 
Plateau (in Meghalaya).

Floodplains are one type of plains formed by rivers 
originating in mountain ranges, where they collect 
particles of rock, sand and silt called ‘sediments’. These 
sediments are carried all the way to the plains, where 
the rivers deposit them, making the soil very fertile. As a 
result, these plains are ideal for growing crops of all kinds, 
and agriculture is a major economic occupation in this 
landform. Plains also support a variety of flora and fauna.

Life in the plains
Thousands of years ago, the first civilisations developed 
around rivers in fertile plains. In our times too, a large part 
of the world’s population lives in plains. 
About 40 crore people, more than one-fourth of the total 
Indian population, live in India’s Ganga plain (often called 
the ‘Gangetic plain’). As with many other plains of the

world, the major occupations of people in this region 
include river fishing and agriculture. Food crops such as 
rice, wheat, maize, barley and millets are grown. Fibre 
crops such as cotton, jute and hemp are also grown in the 
Gangetic plain. Traditional agriculture has been mostly 
rainfed (that is, watered through rainfall). In recent 
decades, however, agriculture has turned to irrigation, 
with water brought to the fields through networks of 
canals or pumped from groundwater. While irrigation has 
increased agricultural production, it has also contributed to 
the depletion (or decrease) of groundwater. This presents a 
challenge for the future of agriculture in the region. Some 
of the other problems affecting the Ganga plains include 
high population and pollution.
Whether in mountain ranges or plains, rivers around the 
world have carried immense cultural value. In particular, 
many communities have considered a river’s source and 
its confluence with one or two other rivers to be sacred. 
In India, numerous festivals, ceremonies and rituals are 
conducted at such locations.
Because plains have a gentle slope, river navigation is easy 
and supports a lot of economic activities. In earlier days, 
people also used rivers extensively to travel from one place

The five tiṇais of ancient Tamil Sangam poetry are five 
landscapes associated with certain specific deities, lifestyles, 
moods or emotions (such as love, longing, separation, quarrel, 
etc.). This table only lists the characteristics of the five 
landscapes and the main human occupations in each:

Tiṇai Landscape Main occupation

Kuriñji mountainous regions hunting and gathering

Mullai grassland and forests cattle rearing

Marudam fertile agricultural plains farming

Neydal coastal regions fishing and seafaring

Pālai arid, desert-like regions journeying and fighting

These five tiṇais constitute a different classification of 
landforms than the one we have seen, but they reflect a keen 
awareness of the diverse regions and their characteristics. 
They also illustrate the deep connection between humanity 
and the natural environment. (You do not need to remember 
the details of the tiṇais, but the concepts they reflect need to be 
understood.)

Before we move on ...
Æ Landforms are classified into three main types — 

mountains, plateaus and plains. They have very  
different physical characteristics and environments.

Æ Throughout history, people’s lives and activities have been 
much impacted by the type of landform they have lived in. 
These landforms are an integral part of culture across the 
world. Indian culture, in particular, has celebrated them in 
diverse ways.

Æ Each landform offers different challenges as well  
as opportunities.

ago that was? 

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Such calculations are simple, but there is a catch. In the 

Gregorian calendar, there is no ‘year zero’. The year 1 CE 
follows immediately the year 1 BCE. Draw a simple timeline 
marking every year from 2 BCE to 2 CE; you will see that 
because of the absence of a year zero, only 3 years have 
passed between those two dates. 

Æ So to calculate the number of years between a BCE date 
and a CE date, you should add them but subtract 1 — in the 
above case, 2 + 2 – 1 = 3. 

Æ Practice a few examples with your classmates. For example, 
to return to the question about the Buddha, suppose we 
are now in the year 2024 CE, then the Buddha was born 
560 + 2024 – 1 = 2,583 years ago.

A timeline (see Fig. 4.3 on pages 62 and 63) is a convenient 
tool to mark such events, as it shows a sequence of dates 
and events covering any particular period. It runs from the 
beginning of humanity to the present, with a few important 
landmarks. Note that the dotted portion marks a skipped 
period; otherwise, this timeline would have to be almost 3 
metres long!

A timeline also helps in understanding the order in which 
historical events take place. For example, even without 
looking at dates, you can now see that the birth of Buddha 
occurs before that of Jesus. 

DON’T MISS OUT
Along with a year and a decade (a period of ten years), we often 
use other terms to understand longer durations of time. Two of 
these are quite commonly used when learning about history.
1. Century: It is any period of 100 years. In history, specific 

centuries are counted every 100 years starting from the 
year 1 CE. For instance, we are currently in the 21st century 

64 CE, which runs from 2001 to 2100.

4_100724_v9.indd   64 11-Jul-24   4:25:18 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond 
Tapestry of the Past



 The centuries BCE are calculated beginning from the 
year 1 BCE and keep going back in time. For example, the 
3rd  century BCE would include the years 300 BCE to 
201 BCE.

2. Millennium: It is any period of 1,000 years. In history, 
specific centuries are counted every 1,000 years from 
the year 1  CE. For instance, we are currently in the 
3rd millennium CE, which began in 2001 CE and will go up 
to 3000 CE. 

 As with centuries, millenniums BCE are also calculated 
beginning from 1  BCE and go backwards. So the 
1st millennium BCE would include the years 1  BCE to 
1000 BCE.

 In the timeline given on pages 62 and 63 (Fig. 4.3), can 
you mark the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE? (Note: 
In English, the plural of ‘millennium’ is ‘millenniums’ or 
‘millennia’; both are correct.)

LET’S EXPLORE
Create a timeline stretching from 1900 CE to the current year

Do you know how calendars have been traditionally made in 
India? Many Indian calendars rely on the positions of the sun 
and the moon to define the months of the year. A pañchānga is 
a book of tables which lists the days of each month along with 
related astronomical data; for instance, it precisely predicts 
events like solar and lunar eclipses, times for sunrise and 
sunset, etc. Pañchāngas, still widely used in India, often also 
give weather predictions for the year, dates and timings of 
festivals, and more. 65

The Beginnings of Human History
Modern humans (Homo sapiens) have walked the planet 
for about 300,000 (three lakh) years. This appears to be a 
very long time, yet it is only a tiny fraction of the Earth’s 
history. Let us have a quick look at our early history.

LET’S EXPLORE
In the above picture, look at some activities of early humans 
in a rock shelter. Which ones can you recognise? Give a brief 
description for each.

Early humans faced many challenges from nature and lived 
in bands or groups to help each other. They were constantly 
seeking shelter and food, and were mainly hunters and 

Afterlife: gatherers; this means that they relied on hunting and 
A life collecting edible plants and fruits for their survival. Our

These groups lived in temporary camps, rock shelters or 
caves, and communicated with each other using languages 
that are now lost. They used fire and started making objects 
that made their lives easier, like improved stone axes and 
blades, arrowheads and other tools. Aspects of their life 
are visible in rock paintings found in hundreds of caves 
all over the world. Some of those paintings depict simple 
figures or a few symbols; others are more detailed and 
represent scenes with animals or humans. In time, these 
early humans learned to make simple ornaments such as 
stone or shell beads, pendants made of animal teeth, and 
sometimes exchanged them with other groups.

The First Crops
Over long ages, the Earth’s climate has gone through many 
changes. At certain times, it was very cold and much of the 
Earth was covered with ice — this is called an ‘Ice Age’, as 
you will learn in greater detail in Science. Later, when the 
climate warmed up, this ice partly melted, and the resulting 
waters swelled the existing rivers and eventually drained 
into the oceans. The last Ice Age lasted from over 100,000 
(one lakh) years ago to around 12,000 years ago. 
Afterwards, living conditions improved for humans; in many 
parts of the world, they started settling down and cultivating 
cereals and grains. They also domesticated animals such as 
cattle, goats, etc. With more food available, these communities 
grew in size and number, and often settled down near rivers. 
This was not only because of the availability of water, but 
also because the soil would be more fertile there. It made the 
process of growing crops easier. 

LET’S EXPLORE
Observe the scene on the next  page. It depicts an agricultural 
community from a few millenniums ago. List the main activities 
you can identify. 71

THINK ABOUT IT
 Both in this earlier picture of a rock shelter and in this one, 

men and women are given certain roles. While they may 
appear to be ‘natural’, they are not necessarily correct and 
do not cover all situations. For instance, in a rock shelter, 
women may have helped prepare colours for painting 
the rock or may have done some of the painting. In both 
scenes, men may have done some of the cooking or may 
have helped take care of children. 

 Keeping in mind that we have only limited information, 
think about such roles and situations, and discuss in class.

of the people, and everyone collectively worked towards Welfare:

for making pots and other clay objects; and the use of metal

objects of daily use and ornaments. 
We will see in Chapter 6 how this stage prepared for 
the emergence of what is called ‘civilisation’. For now, 
it is important to remember that this early progress of 
humanity had to face many challenges. At some critical 
times, humanity could have almost disappeared, as some 
earlier species did. We will never know those early humans 
to whose courage and persistence we owe our existence 
today.

Today, the India we know is a modern nation, with defined 
borders, defined states and a known population. However, 
it was very different 500 years ago, 2,000 years ago or even 
5,000 years ago. This region of the world, which we often call 
the ‘Indian Subcontinent’, has had many different names 
and shifting boundaries. We can learn about India’s past 
and evolution from many different sources. Let us explore.

THINK ABOUT IT 
Consider the physical map of the Indian Subcontinent at 
the start of the chapter. What are its natural boundaries 
that you can make out?

In the course of history, India has been called by many Inhabitants: 
names — both by its inhabitants and by visitors from outside. People who 

live in a

travellers and pilgrims, and inscriptions. place.

How Indians Named 
India
The Ṛig Veda is India’s most ancient 
text; as we will see in Chapter 7, 
it is several thousand years old. 
It gives the northwest region of 
the Subcontinent the name ‘Sapta 
Sindhava’, that is, the ‘land of the 
seven rivers’. The word ‘Sindhava’ 
comes from ‘Sindhu’, which refers 
to the Indus River, or at times to a 
river in general.

of the Indian Subcontinent

5 ― India, That Is Bharat



Moving on in time, we see names for other parts of India 
appear in the literature. The Mahābhārata is one of India’s 
most famous texts (we read about it in the theme ‘Our 
Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions’). Interestingly, 
it lists many regions, such as Kāshmīra (more or less today’s 
Kashmir), Kurukṣhetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga 
(parts of Bengal), Prāgjyotiṣha (roughly today’s Assam), 
Kaccha (today’s Kutch), Kerala (more or less today’s Kerala), 
and so on. 

LET’S EXPLORE
Do you recognise the names of any regions given in the map 
(Fig. 5.4) on page 79? List the ones that you have heard of.

But when do we come across a name for the entire Indian 
Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to 
date, this is not an easy question to answer. The Mahābhārata 
uses the terms ‘Bhāratavarṣha’ and ‘Jambudvīpa’, and 
scholars generally agree that this long poem was written 
from a few centuries BCE onward. 
The first term, ‘Bhāratavarṣha’, clearly extends to the entire 
Subcontinent, and the text includes the names of numerous 
rivers and peoples. ‘Bhāratavarṣha’ means ‘the country of 
the Bharatas’. ‘Bharata’ is a name that first appears in the 
Ṛig Veda, where it refers to one of the main Vedic groups 
of people. In later literature, several kings named ‘Bharata’ 
are mentioned. 
The second term, ‘Jambudvīpa’, means ‘the island of the 
fruit of the jamun tree’. This is indeed a common tree native 
to India, also called ‘jambul tree’, ‘Malabar plum tree’, etc. 
‘Jambudvīpa’ came to mean the Indian Subcontinent.
In fact, we get a good clue from an Indian emperor — his 
name is Aśhoka and we will meet him later; for now, we 
can take his date to be about 250 BCE. As we will see, he 

78 left us many inscriptions. In one of them, he used the same

name ‘Jambudvīpa’ to describe the whole of India, which 
at the time included what is today Bangladesh, Pakistan, as 
well as parts of Afghanistan.

5 ― India, That Is Bharat



A few centuries later, ‘Bhārata’ became the name generally 
used for the Indian Subcontinent. For instance, in an ancient 
text called the Viṣhṇu Purāṇa, we read:

uttaram yat samudrasya himādreścaiva
dakṣiṇam varṣam tad bhāratam nāma ...

 “The country that lies north of the ocean
and south of the snowy mountains is 

called Bhārata.”

This name, ‘Bhārata’ remains in use even today. In north 
India, it is generally written as ‘Bharat’, while in south 
India, it is often ‘Bharatam’.

THINK ABOUT IT
Have you identified the ‘snowy mountains’? Do you think this 
brief description of Bhārata is correct?

It is interesting to note that different parts of the country 
adopted a similar definition for India. For instance, a poem 
of ancient Tamil literature, from about 2,000 years ago, 
praises a king whose name is known “from [Cape] Kumari 
in the south, from the great mountain in the north, from 
the oceans on the east and on the west...” You can now 
recognise ‘the great mountain in the north’, and it should 
not be difficult to identify ‘Cape Kumari’. It looks like ancient 
Indians knew their geography well!

How Foreigners Named India
The first foreigners to mention India were the Persians, 
the ancient inhabitants of Iran. In the 6th century BCE, a 
Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained 
control of the region of the Indus River, which, as we saw, 
was earlier called ‘Sindhu’. So, it is no surprise that in their 
earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred 
to India as ‘Hind’, ‘Hidu’ or ‘Hindu’, which are adaptations 
in their language of ‘Sindhu’. (Note that in ancient Persian, 
‘Hindu’ is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here 
to the Hindu religion.) 
Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named 
the region ‘Indoi’ or  ‘Indike’. They dropped the initial letter 
‘h’ of ‘Hindu’ because this letter did not exist in their Greek 
language. 

Sindhu Hindhu Indoi / Indike

The ancient Chinese also interacted with India. In several 
texts, they refer to India as ‘Yintu’ or ‘Yindu’. This word also 
originally comes from ‘Sindhu’, in the following manner:

Xuanzang (formerly spelt Hiuen Tsang, Hsuan 
Tsang, etc.) travelled from China to India in the 
7th century CE. He visited many parts of India, met 
scholars, collected Buddhist texts, and returned 
to China after 17 years. There, he translated 
the manuscripts he took back with him from 
Sanskrit into Chinese. Several other Chinese 
scholars visited India over the centuries.

Another Chinese word, also derived from 
‘Sindhu’, was ‘Tianzhu’; but this word could 
also be understood as ‘heavenly master’. This 
reflects the respect the ancient Chinese had 
for India as the land of the Buddha.
You are probably quite familiar with a 
more recent term, ‘Hindustān’, but you may 
not know that it was first used in a Persian 
inscription some 1,800 years ago! Later on, this became 
the term used by most invaders of India to describe the 
Indian Subcontinent.

The Beginnings of 
Indian Civilisation 6 

The most ancient civilisation of India, known variously as the 
Harappan, Indus or Indus-Sarasvatī Civilisation, was indeed 
remarkable in many ways. ... [It showed how] a well-balanced 
community lives — in which the differences between the rich 
and the poor are not glaring. ... In essence, the Harappan 
societal scenario was not that of ‘exploitation’, but of mutual 
‘accommodation’.

of extracting technologies (such as construction, metallurgy, transport) 
metals from

purifying or What, then, is civilisation? In general, the term is used for 

combining 
them, as well an advanced stage of human societies. To be precise, we 

as the scientific will consider here that a ‘civilisation’ should have at least 
study of metals 

and their the following characteristics:
properties.

 some form of government and administration — to 
manage a more complex society and its many activities

 urbanism — town-planning, the growth of cities and 
their management, which generally includes water 
management and a drainage system

 a variety of crafts — including the management of raw 
materials (such as stone or metal) and the production 
of finished goods (such as ornaments and tools)

 trade both internal (within a city or a region) and 
external (with distant regions or other parts of the 
world) — to exchange all sorts of goods

 some form of writing — needed to keep records and to 
communicate

 cultural ideas about life and the world, expressed 
through art, architecture, literature, oral traditions or 
social customs

 a productive agriculture — enough to feed not just 
the villages, but also the cities.

THINK ABOUT IT
Which of the above characteristics do you think is the most 
fundamental — that is, a characteristic essential to the 
development of all others?

LET’S EXPLORE
For each characteristic in the list above, can you make a list of 
professions or occupations that might exist in such a society? 

It is easy enough to see that all these characteristics are 
present in most societies in the world today. But when did 
civilisation begin, in the sense we have now defined? 
Civilisation began at different times in different parts of the 
world. In the region known as Mesopotamia (modern Iraq 
and Syria), that happened about 6,000 years ago, and the 
civilisation in ancient Egypt followed a few centuries later. 
You will learn about these and a few more civilisations in a 
later grade. In many ways, humanity would not have reached 
its present stage without the enormous contributions and 
advances of those ancient civilisations.
For now, however, we will only look at the Indian 
Subcontinent, and its northwest region is where our story 
begins.

Archaeologists gave this civilisation 
several names — ‘Indus’, ‘Harappan’, 
‘Indus-Sarasvatī’ or ‘Sindhu-Sarasvatī’ 
civilisation. We will use all these terms. 
Its inhabitants are called ‘Harappans’. 
It is one of the oldest civilisations in the 
world.

DON’T MISS OUT
Why are the inhabitants of this civilisation called ‘Harappans’ 
today? That is simply because the city of Harappa (today in 
Pakistan’s Punjab) was the first of this civilisation to be exca-
vated, way back in 1920–21, over a century ago.

This development is also called the ‘First Urbanisation of 
India’.

  The Sarasvatī River
The map (Fig. 6.3 on page 89) shows the Indus (or 
Sindhu) and its five main tributaries; important 
cities grew along those rivers, such as Mohenjo-daro 
and Harappa. But there are also many sites along 
the Sarasvatī River, which today goes by the name 
of ‘Ghaggar’ in India and ‘Hakra’ in Pakistan (hence 
the name ‘Ghaggar-Hakra River’). This river is now 
seasonal, because it flows only during the rainy season.
The Sarasvatī River is first mentioned in the Ṛig Veda, an 
ancient collection of prayers which we will read about 
in Chapter 7. In this text, Sarasvatī is worshipped both 
as a goddess and as a river flowing ‘from the mountain 
to the sea’. Later texts describe the river as drying up 
and eventually disappearing.

Town-Planning
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, now in Pakistan, were the 
first two cities of this civilisation to be discovered; their 
identification goes back to 1924, a century ago. Several sites 
followed in the Indus plains, which is why the civilisation 
was initially called ‘Indus Valley civilisation’. 
Later on, other major cities, such as Dholavira (in Gujarat), 
Rakhigarhi (in Haryana), Ganweriwala (in the Cholistan 

90 desert of Pakistan), and hundreds of smaller sites (such

THINK ABOUT IT
You may have come across the term ‘Indus Valley 
civilisation’ and noticed that we have not used it. A look at 
the map (Fig. 6.3 on page 89) explains why the term ‘Valley’ 
is obsolete, as we now know that the civilisation extended 
much beyond the Indus region.

as Lothal in Gujarat), were discovered, some of them 
excavated. Such discoveries continue even today! It is 
interesting to note that the Sarasvatī basin includes not only 
two major cities — Rakhigarhi and Ganweriwala — but also Fortification: 
several smaller ones (Farmana in Haryana, Kalibangan in A massive wall 
Rajasthan) and a few towns (Bhirrana and Banawali, both surrounding a 

settlement or 
in Haryana); indeed, the map (Fig. 6.3 on page 89) makes city, generally 
clear the high density of sites in that region. for protective 

purposes.
The larger Harappan cities were built according to precise 
plans. They had wide streets (Fig. 6.4 and 6.5 on page 92), Elite: Here, the

people lived. priests.
Some large buildings seem to have been used for collective 
purposes — for instance, warehouses where goods to be 
transported were stored. Individual houses of various sizes 
lined the streets and smaller lanes. Interestingly, the quality 
of construction was the same for small and big houses. All 
those buildings were generally made of bricks.
The purpose of some of the structures remains a matter 
of debate. This is the case of the famous ‘Great Bath’ in 
Mohenjo-daro (Fig. 6.6 on page 93), a small but elaborate 
tank which measured about 12 x 7 metres and had 
waterproofing materials (such as natural bitumen, a form 
of tar) applied on top of carefully laid-out bricks. The tank 91

was surrounded by small rooms, one of which contained a 
well; there was a drain in one corner of the tank to empty it 
from time to time and refill it with freshwater. 

 Fig. 6.6. Mohenjo-daro’s Great Bath

What was the purpose of such a structure? Archaeologists 
have proposed several possible interpretations — a public 
bath for people; a bath for the royal family only; or a tank 
used for religious rituals. The first interpretation is now 
ruled out because it turns out that in this city, most houses 
had individual bathrooms.

LET’S EXPLORE
Have a debate in class about the last two interpretations. Can 
you think of any others? Remember that in this case, we do not 
have any other source of history — no inscription, no text, no 
traveller’s account.

Water Management
The Harappans gave much importance to water manage-
ment and cleanliness. They often had separate areas for 
bathing in their homes; these were connected to a larger 
network of drains (Fig. 6.7), which generally ran below the 
streets and took the waste water away. 

 Fig. 6.7. Drainage system at Lothal (Gujarat)

In Mohenjo-daro, people drew water from hundreds of 
94 wells made of bricks. But in other regions, it may have been

As a class activity, measure the length of your classroom, a

At Dholavira, at least six large reservoirs were built with 
stones or even cut into the rock (Fig. 6.8). Most of them were 
connected through underground drains for efficient water 
harvesting and distribution.

THINK ABOUT IT
Imagine the large number of workers required to build such 
a network of reservoirs. Who do you think organised their 
work and gave them precise instructions? How do you think 
they were paid for their labour? (Hint: there was no money 
at that time in the way we have today.) Since the reservoirs 
needed to be cleaned from time to time, was there some 
local authority to manage their maintenance? What clues 
do we get from all this about this city’s ruler and municipal 
administration? 
Use your imagination and discuss with your teacher.
Archaeologists also discuss these questions, and the answers 
are not always final!

What Did the Harappans Eat?
The Harappans created many of their settlements along the 
banks of large or small rivers. This is a logical choice, not 
just for easy access to water, but also for agriculture, since 

Pulses: 
A category rivers enrich the soil around them. Archaeological findings 

of crops that have shown that the Harappans grew cereals like barley, 
includes 

beans, peas wheat, some millets, and sometimes rice, in addition to 
and lentils pulses and a variety of vegetables. They were also the first 

(dal). in Eurasia to grow cotton, which they used to weave into 
clothes. They made farming tools, including the plough 
(Fig. 6.9), some of which continue to be used by modern-
day farmers.

Tapestry of the Past



This intense agricultural activity was managed by hun-
dreds of small rural sites or villages. Then as now, the cities 
could survive only if enough agricultural produce from 
rural areas reached them on a daily basis.
The Harappans also domesticated a number of animals for 
meat consumption and fished both in rivers and in the sea. 
This is known from the large numbers of animal and fish 
bones found during excavations. 
What did Harappan cooking pots contain? Scientific 
examinations of clay pots have provided some answers, 
both expected ones (dairy products) and surprising ones — 
such as remains of turmeric, ginger and banana. Clearly, 
their diet was quite diverse!

LET US EXPLORE
Imagine you cook a meal in a Harappan house. What dish or 
dishes would you prepare, based on the data given above?

A Brisk Trade 
The Harappans were engaged in active trade, not only 
within their own civilisation (other cities nearby or far 
away), but with other civilisations and cultures within 
and outside India. They exported ornaments, timber, some 
objects of daily use (Fig. 6.11 on page 98), probably also 
gold and cotton, and possibly some food items. The most 
favoured ornaments were beads of carnelian (Fig. 6.10 on 
page 98), a reddish semiprecious stone found mostly in 
Gujarat. Harappan craftspeople developed special tech-
niques to drill them, so a string could pass through them, 
and to decorate them in various ways. They also worked 
conch shells into beautiful shell bangles, which requires 
sophisticated techniques as shell is a hard material.
What the Harappans imported in exchange of the exported 
goods is not so clear. It probably included copper, since this 
metal was not so common back home.

6 ― The Beginnings of Indian Civilisation



DON’T MISS OUT
The Harappans mastered the art of working copper, a soft metal. 
If tin is added to copper, the resulting metal is bronze, which is 
harder than copper. The Harappans used bronze to make tools, 
pots and pans, and, as we will see later, some figurines.

Fig. 6.11. Harappan ivory comb (about 7 cm long) 
found on the coast of Oman

To conduct such a trade, they used 
land routes and rivers, and the sea 
for more distant destinations — 
this is the first intensive maritime 
activity in India. Indeed, quite a 
few Harappan settlements are

small settlement in Gujarat, has 
a surprisingly huge basin measuring 217 metres in length 
and 36 metres in width — the length is just a little more than 
that of two football grounds! This basin must have been a 
dockyard, that is, a structure used to receive and send boats 
for further transportation of goods.
Such elaborate trade requires traders to be able to identify 
their goods — and also each other! This seems to have 
been the chief purpose of thousands of small seals, which 

98 have been excavated from many settlements. These seals

be hardened through heating. They measure only a few 
centimetres and generally depict animal figures with, above 
them, a few signs that are part of a writing system. But that 
system and the symbolic meaning of the animal figures are 
yet to be understood. What is certain is that they somehow 
relate to trade activities.

THINK ABOUT IT
 Looking at the objects on pages 100 and 101 — or any 

other pictured in this chapter — can you make out 
what activities or aspects of life were important for the 
Harappans?

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Complete the story found on the Lothal pot. How was 

such a story remembered for more than 4,000 years, in 
your opinion?

Æ Consider the ‘Dancing Girl’ figurine. What do you make of 
the attitude the figurine expresses? Observe her bangles 
covering an entire arm, a practice still visible in parts of 
Gujarat and Rajasthan. Where else in this chapter can 
you spot bangles worn in this manner. What conclusion 
should we draw from this?

The End or a New Beginning?
Around 1900 BCE, this Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation, despite 
all its achievements, began to fall apart. The cities were 
abandoned one by one. If any inhabitants remained, they 
adopted a rural lifestyle in the changed environment — it 
appears that the earlier government or administration no 
longer existed. Gradually the Harappans scattered over 
hundreds, if not thousands, of small rural settlements. 

THINK ABOUT IT
The Harappans returned to rural settlements because a rural 
lifestyle gives easier access to food and water than an urban 
lifestyle. Then as now, cities depended on villages to provide 
food, and sometimes water. 

What caused this decline? Archaeologists have proposed 
102 many factors. Long back, it was thought that warfare or 

6-100724_v8.indd   102 11-Jul-24   4:25:30 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond 
Tapestry of the Past



invasions may have destroyed the cities, but there is no 
trace of warfare or invasion. Indeed, the Harappans do not 
seem to have kept any army or weapons of war; as far as the 
evidence goes, it seems to have been a relatively peaceful 
civilization.
Two factors are currently agreed upon. First, a climatic 
change which affected much of the world from 2200 BCE 
onward, causing reduced rainfall and a drier phase. This 
would have made agriculture more difficult and could have 
reduced food supply to the cities. Second, the Sarasvatī 
River dried up in its central basin; suddenly, cities there, 
such as Kalibangan or Banawali were abandoned. There 
could have been other factors, but these two remind us of 
how much we depend on climate and the environment for 
our well-being.
Although the cities disappeared, much of the Harappan 
culture and technology survived and was passed on to the 
next phase of Indian civilisation, which we will explore in 
a future chapter.

Before we move on …
Æ The Indus, Harappan or Sindhu-Sarasvatī civilisation 

is one of the oldest of the world. Its inhabitants, the 
Harappans, created planned cities with efficient water 
management, diverse crafts and a brisk trade.

Æ A productive agriculture brought a variety of crops to the 
cities.

Æ The civilisation eventually declined, probably because of 
climatic and environmental changes; people returned to a 
rural lifestyle.

we can understand ‘India, that is Bharat’ better.

The Vedas and Vedic Culture
a. What are the Vedas? 
The word “Veda” comes from the Sanskrit vid which 
means ‘knowledge’ (hence vidyā, for instance). We briefly 
mentioned the Ṛig Veda in earlier chapters. In fact, there 
are four Vedas — the Ṛig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sāma 
Veda and the Atharva Veda. They are the most ancient texts 
of India, and indeed among the most ancient in the world. 
The Vedas consist of thousands of hymns — prayers in the 
form of poems and songs — that were recited orally, not 
written. Those hymns were composed in the Sapta Sindhava 
region (which we visit in Chapter 5). It is difficult to say 
when exactly the Ṛig Veda, the most ancient of the four, 
was composed; experts have proposed dates ranging from

b. Vedic society
Early Vedic society was organised in different janas or 
‘clans’, that is, larger groups of people. The Ṛig Veda alone 
lists over 30 such janas — for instance, the Bharatas, the 
Purus, the Kurus, the Yadus, the Turvaśhas etc. Each clan 
was associated with a particular region of the northwest 
part of the Subcontinent.

Not much is known of how these janas governed their 
society. The Vedas only give us a few clues through words 
like rājā (a king or ruler), sabhā  and samiti, both of which 
refer to a collective gathering or assembly.

Do you know the term for a society where people select their

situation? What could happen if they live under leaders that 
they did not choose? (Hint: Think back to what you’re learning 
in the theme ‘Governance and Democracy’!) Write your thoughts 
in a paragraph of 100–150 words.

c. Vedic schools of thought
Vedic culture also developed many rituals (yajña, often 
read as ‘yagya’) directed towards various deities (gods or 
goddesses) for individual or collective benefit and wellbeing.
Daily rituals were generally in the form of prayers and 
offerings to Agni, the deity associated with fire, but those 
rituals became more and more complex in the course of 
time.
A group of texts known as ‘Upaniṣhads’ built upon Vedic 
concepts and introduced new ones, such as rebirth (taking 
birth again and again) and karma (our actions or their 
results). According to one school of thought, generally 
known as ‘Vedanta’, everything — human life, nature and 
the universe — is one divine essence called brahman (not 
to be confused with the god Brahmā) or sometimes just tat 
(‘that’). Two well-known mantras express this in a simple 
but profound way: 109

7-100724_v10A.indd   109 11-Jul-24   4:24:52 PM

7 ― India’s Cultural Roots



aham brahmāsmi
“I am brahman” (that is to say, I am divine)

tat tvam asi...
 “You are That”

The Upaniṣhads also introduced the concept of ātman or 
Self — the divine essence that resides in every being but 
is ultimately one with brahman. It follows that everything 
in this world is connected and interdependent. This 
explains a common prayer that begins with sarve bhavantu 
sukhinah, or “May all creatures be happy”, and goes on to

systems. One of them is Buddhism.

Many stories from the Upaniṣhads tell us the importance of 
asking questions, whether these questions come from men, 
women or children.

Śhvetaketu and the seed of reality 
(Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad)
Rishi Uddālaka Āruṇi sent his 
son, Śhvetaketu, to a gurukula 
to learn the Vedas. When 
Śhvetaketu returned 12 years 
later, his father realised he 
had become very proud of 
his learning. So Uddālaka 
tested him with questions on 
the nature of brahman, which 
Śhvetaketu could not answer.
Uddālaka proceeded to explain how brahman, though invisible, 
is everywhere, just as the seed of a banyan fruit seems empty 
when you open it, but already contains the future banyan tree; 
or just as all kinds of different pots can be made out of the same 
clay. Similarly, everything around us has emerged from the 
same essence — brahman. He concluded his teaching with these 
words, “Everything consists of this subtle essence. ... You are 
That, Śhvetaketu.”

Nachiketa and his quest  
(Katha Upaniṣhad)
Once, a man was giving away all his possessions in a ritual. As his 
son Nachiketa kept asking him which god he would be offered 
to, the father became angry and answered, “I give you to Yama” 
— that is, to the god of death.
Nachiketa, then, proceeded to Yama’s world and, after a long 
wait, met the mighty god. One question was on his mind — “What

happens after the death of 
the body?” Yama tried to 
avoid answering, but the 
boy persisted. Pleased, Yama 
explained that the ātman, 
or self, is hidden within 
all creatures. It is neither 
born, nor does it die; it is 
immortal. Having acquired 
this profound knowledge, 
Nachiketa returned to his 
father, who welcomed him 
joyfully. 

The debate of Gārgī and Yājñavalkya  
(Bṛihadāraṇyaka  Upaniṣhad)
Once, the wise king Janaka announced a prize for the winner 
of a philosophical debate. Yājñavalkya, a renowned rishi, came 
to the king’s court and defeated many scholars until Gārgī, 
a rishika, asked him a series of questions on the nature of 

the world, and finally on the 
nature of brahman. At that 
point, Yājñavalkya asked 
her to stop asking further 
questions. Later, however, 
Gārgī resumed her questions 
and Yājñavalkya went on 
to explain how brahman 
is what makes the world, 
the seasons, the rivers and 
everything else possible.

Nepal). Depending on the sources they use, scholars have 
come up with widely different conclusions as regards the 
precise year of his birth. In Chapter 4, we chose 560 BCE as 
an approximate year. In any case, it makes no difference to 
our story here.
As the story goes, then, Siddhārtha  Gautama grew up living 
a protected life in the palace. One day, at the age of 29, he 
asked to be driven through the city in a chariot, and for the Ascetic:

Siddhārtha, then, became 
known as the ‘Buddha’, which 
means the ‘enlightened’ or 
‘awakened’ one.
The Buddha started teaching 
what he had realised, including 
the idea of ahimsa, which is 
generally translated as ‘non-
violence’, but originally means 
‘non-hurting’ or ‘non-injuring’. 
He also insisted on a sincere 
inner discipline. The following 
saying of his expresses this 
simply:

Æ Discuss the way the Buddha is depicted in the above panel.
Æ Can you name some states of India or some other countries 

where Buddhism is a major religion even today? Try to plot 
these on a world map. 

Jainism
Jainism is another important school 
of thought that became widespread 
at the same time, although its roots 
are said to be much more ancient. 
Just like Siddhārtha  Gautama, Prince 
Vardhamāna was born into a royal 
family in the early 6th century BCE. 
His birthplace was near the city of 
Vaiśhālī, in modern-day Bihar. At 
the age of 30, he decided to leave his 
home and go in search of spiritual 
knowledge. He practised an ascetic 
discipline and, after 12 years, achieved 
‘infinite knowledge’ or supreme wisdom. 
He became known as ‘Mahāvīra’, or 
‘great hero’, and started preaching what A traditional painting of Mahāvīra

he had realised. 

   DON’T MISS OUT
The word ‘Jain’ or  jaina comes from jina, meaning ‘conqueror’. 
This does not refer to the conquest of territory or enemies, but 
to the conquest of ignorance and attachments, so as to reach 
enlightenment.

Jain teachings include ahimsa, anekāntavāda and 
aparigraha. These ideas, shared to a large extent with 
Buddhism and the Vedantic school of thought, are central 115

7-100724_v10A.indd   115 11-Jul-24   4:25:09 PM

to Indian culture. The first may be illustrated by this saying 
of Mahāvīra:

 “All breathing, existing, living, sentient 
creatures should not be slain, nor treated 
with violence, nor abused, nor tormented, 

nor driven away.”

Let us define the last two in simple terms:
 Anekāntavāda means ‘not just one’ aspect or 

perspective. That is, the truth has many aspects and 
cannot be fully described by any single statement.

 Aparigraha means ‘non-possession’ and advises 
detachment from material possessions, limiting 
oneself to what is truly necessary in life.

Jainism also insists on the interconnectedness and 
interdependence of all creatures, from humans to invisible 
organisms, as they support each other and cannot live 
without one another. Scientists studying nature, flora and 
fauna, have again and again confirmed this deep truth.

The Jātaka tales, which have delighted generations of Indian 
children and adults, tell stories of the Buddha’s former births 
and express in simple terms the Buddhist values.
In a well-known tale, the Buddha was the king of a large 
troop of monkeys. They lived near a huge tree which bore 
fruit of divine fragrance and taste. Despite the monkey-
king’s instructions that no fruit should escape, one day a ripe 
fruit fell into the stream below. Carried by the current, it was 

116

caught in a net and taken to the palace. The king was so enchanted by 
its taste that he ordered his soldiers to locate the tree it came from. 
After a long search, they found the tree — and the monkeys enjoying 
the tree’s fruits. The soldiers attacked 
the monkeys. The only way for the 
monkey-king to save his monkeys 
was to help them cross the stream, 
but they could not do so on their own. 
Being much larger than them, the 
monkey-king caught hold of a tree on 
the other bank and let them use his 
body as a bridge to cross the stream, 
although he was severely bruised in 
the process and eventually died.
The king, who watched the scene from 
a distance, was greatly moved by the A stone panel (at Bharhut in 
monkey-king’s selfless sacrifice. He Madhya Pradesh) depicting the 
thought about the role of a king with story of the monkey-king
respect to his subjects.

A Jain story
Rohineya was an extraordinarily skilled burglar who evaded all 
attempts to catch him. On his way to a city, he accidentally heard 
a few sentences from a sermon that Mahāvīra was giving about 
achieving liberation from the ordinary life of ignorance. Reaching 
the city, Rohineya was recognised and arrested. He pretended to be 
a simple farmer. A minister devised a clever plan to force him to 
confess his identity. But Rohineya, remembering Mahāvīra’s words, 
was able to detect the minister’s plan and defeat it. 
Feeling remorseful, Rohineya approached Mahāvīra, confessed his 
crimes, returned the stolen treasures, and asked for forgiveness. He 
became a monk, realised the illusion he was living in and focused on 
acquiring higher knowledge.
The story illustrates the importance of right action and right 
thinking, and also illustrates the fact that everyone should have a 
second chance.

 LET’S EXPLORE  
Observe the above panel (from a Jain temple in New Delhi). 
What is striking about it? What messages does it carry?

THINK ABOUT IT
In both Buddhism and Jainism, ahimsa means much more 
than refraining from physical violence against a person or 
an animal. It also means refraining from violence in thought, 
such as having ill feelings towards anyone. If we observe 
ourselves carefully, we may notice such negative thoughts and 
learn to turn them into positive ones. Sometimes such negative 
thoughts are even directed at ourselves!

In both Buddhism and Jainism, monks, and sometimes 
nuns too, began travelling across the land to spread their 
respective teachings far and wide. Some of them created 
new monasteries in faraway places, while others led ascetic 
lives in caves cut in the rock. Archaeological findings have 
revealed many traces of those monasteries, sometimes even 
the names of the monks who lived in the rock-cut caves and 
slept on the stone beds!

Caves cut into the rock at Ellora (Maharashtra) between the 6th and the 10th centuries CE. 
Some of the caves are Hindu, others are Buddhist and Jain.

THINK ABOUT IT
In English, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism are often 
labelled ‘religions’. You may notice that we have avoided this 
term, preferring ‘schools of thought’ and (later in this chapter) 
‘belief systems’. This is because there are many aspects to 
those schools and systems, which we will explore gradually — 
a philosophical aspect, a spiritual aspect, a religious aspect, an 
ethical aspect, a social aspect, to name a few. Many scholars 
agree that the word ‘religion’ is too limiting in the context of 
the Indian civilisation.

There were yet other schools of thought at the time. For 
example, one of them, known as the ‘Chārvāka’ school 
(sometimes also ‘Lokāyata’), believed that this material 
world is the only thing that exists, and therefore there can 
be no life after death. This school does not seem to have 
gained much popularity and it disappeared with time. 
We mention it to show that there was a wide diversity of 
intellectual or spiritual belief systems; people were free to 
choose what suited them. 119

7 ― India’s Cultural Roots



Although the Vedic, Buddhist and Jain schools had important 
differences, they also shared some common concepts, 
such as dharma, karma, rebirth, the search for an end to 
suffering and ignorance, and many important values. This 
is the ‘trunk’ of the tree we started this chapter with.

Folk and Tribal Roots
The cultural roots we have seen so far are well documented 
in many texts.  India has also had rich ‘oral traditions’, that 
is, teachings or practices transmitted through everyday 
practice, without written texts (this is the case of the 
Vedas). Among them are numerous folk traditions, that 
is, transmitted by common people, and tribal traditions, 
transmitted by tribes. 

What is a tribe? 
There are many definitions for this social entity. Today, 
anthropologists usually consider a tribe to be a group of 
families or clans sharing a tradition of common descent, a 
culture and a language, living as a close-knit community 
under a chief and holding no private property.
Interestingly, ancient India did not have a word for ‘tribe’ 
— tribes were just different janas that lived in a specific 
environment, such as forests or mountains. The Constitution 
of India uses the terms ‘tribes’ and ‘tribal communities’ in 
English, and janjāti in Hindi.
According to official figures, in 2011 India had 705 tribes 
spread over most States, amounting to a population of about 
104 million people — more than the populations of Australia 
and the United Kingdom together!
In the 19th century, anthropologists studying tribes often 
described them as ‘primitive’ or ‘inferior’ to civilised people. 
With deeper studies of tribal communities and their rich and 
complex cultures, such biased judgments have been mostly 
abandoned.

120

7-100724_v10A.indd   120 11-Jul-24   4:25:18 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond  
Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions



There has been a constant interaction 
between folk and tribal traditions, and 
the leading schools of thought such as 
those we mentioned in this chapter. 
Deities, concepts, legends and rituals 
have been freely exchanged in both 
directions. For instance, according to 
tradition, Jagannath, worshipped at Puri 
(Odisha), was originally a tribal deity; 
this is also the case with various forms of 
the mother-goddess worshipped across 
India. Some tribes, on the other hand, 
adopted Hindu deities long ago, and possess their own 
versions of the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa — this has 
been well documented from India’s northeastern States, all 
the way to Tamil Nadu.
How have such interactions taken place for so 
long and so naturally? It is, in the end, because 
folk, tribal and Hindu belief systems have 
many similar concepts. For instance, in all 
three, elements of nature such as mountains, 
rivers, trees, plants and animals, and some 
stones too, are regarded as sacred, because 
there is consciousness behind all of them. 
Indeed, tribes generally worship many deities 
associated with those natural elements. For the 
Toda tribals of the Nilgiris of Tamil Nadu, for 
instance (one of them is pictured in the image on the right), 
over thirty peaks of this mountain range are residences of 
a god or a goddess; those peaks are so sacred that the Todas 
avoid pointing to them with a finger. 
But despite this multiplicity of deities, as with Hinduism, 
many tribal groups have a concept of a higher divinity or 
supreme being. For example, several tribes of Arunachal 
Pradesh worship Donyipolo, a combined form of the Sun and 121

7-100724_v10A.indd   121 11-Jul-24   4:25:19 PM

7 ― India’s Cultural Roots



the Moon who later rose to the higher status of a supreme god. 
This is also the case of the god Khandoba in parts of central 
India. In eastern India, the Munda and Santhal tribals, among 
others, worship Singbonga, a supreme deity who created this 
whole world. There are many more such examples.
The Indian sociologist André Béteille summed up this 
situation in these words:

“The thousands of castes and tribes on the Indian 
subcontinent have influenced each other in their 
religious beliefs and practices since the beginning of 
history and before. That the tribal religions have been 
influenced by Hinduism is widely accepted, but it is 
equally true that Hinduism, not only in its formative 
phase but throughout its evolution, has been influenced 
by tribal religions.”

Clearly, the result of this long interaction has been mutual 
enrichment. In this manner, folk and tribal beliefs and 
practices also count among India’s cultural roots. We will 
further develop this point in the next chapter.

Before we move on … 
Æ The Vedas, India’s earliest texts, gave rise to several schools 

of thought. Vedanta and Yoga are among the best known. 
Æ Buddhism and Jainism departed from the authority of 

the Vedas and laid emphasis on some specific values and 
practices. 

Æ Although these schools had different principles and 
methods, they also shared some important concepts; they 
were all looking for the cause of suffering and the means 
of removing ignorance.

Æ Tribal belief systems and art have interacted for 
millenniums with Hinduism. There was free borrowing 
and giving from every side. Tribal belief systems generally 
regard the land and its features as sacred; they often have, 
at the same time, a higher concept of divinity.

the banyan tree as sacred.

CHAPTER

8 – Unity in Diversity, or ‘Many in the One’



A Rich Diversity
If you travel through India by train, you will notice not 
only changing landscapes but also many different types of 
dresses and food; you will hear different languages, familiar 
and unfamiliar, and see different scripts on the way. Even 
within your own region, you will often come across people 
from other parts of India with different customs and 
traditions. This is India’s rich diversity, and it is usually the 
first thing that strikes visitors to our country.
With over 1.4 billion inhabitants (about 18 percent of the 
world’s population), such diversity is not surprising! In the 
late 20th century, the Anthropological Survey of India, a 
national organisation, conducted a massive survey called 
‘People of India project’ of 4,635 communities across all 
States of the country. It counted 325 languages using 25 
scripts; it also observed that many Indians may be called 
migrants, in the sense of people not living near their 
birthplace or with their original community.

LET’S EXPLORE
As a class activity, make lists of (1) the birthplaces of at least 5 
classmates and the birthplaces of their parents; (2) the students’ 
mother tongues and other languages known to them. Discuss 
the results in terms of diversity.

While diversity is indeed beautiful, making sense of it is not 
so easy. Over a century ago, the British historian Vincent 
Smith wondered,

“How, in the face of such bewildering diversity, can a 
history of India be written? … The answer to the query 
is found in the fact that India offers unity in diversity.”

What is meant by ‘unity in diversity’? How shall we perceive 
and express this unity, or the ‘Many in the One’? To answer 

126 this question, we will explore a few dimensions of Indian life.

Food for All
Some of you will have eaten food from different regions of 
India. The number of different dishes and preparations you 
can taste in India must be in their thousands, if not lakhs! 
Yet certain food grains are common to almost every part 
of the country — cereals such as rice, barley and wheat; 
millets such as  pearl millet (bajra), sorghum (jowar), finger 
millet (ragi); and pulses such as various kinds of dals and

grams. All these are called ‘staple grains’ because they 
are the basic food for most Indians (Fig. 8.1 on page 127). 
Similarly, some common spices such as turmeric, cumin, 
cardamom and ginger, are also used throughout the 
country. We could continue this list with some common 
vegetables, common oils etc. 
So we see how the same ingredients (unity) can be used in 
a number of combinations (diversity) to prepare an endless 
variety of dishes!

etc.) that are used in your home.

Textiles and Clothing
Every region and community in 
India has developed its own styles of 
clothing and dresses. Yet, we notice 
a commonality in some traditional 
Indian dresses, irrespective of the 
material used. An obvious example 
is the plain length of cloth called 
the sari, a type of clothing worn in 
most parts of India and made from 
different fabrics — mostly cotton or 

silk, but nowadays synthetic fabrics 
too. Banarasi, Kanjivaram, Paithani, 
Patan Patola, Muga or Mysore are some 
of the famous types of silk saris. There

produced by different methods 
of weaving (Fig. 8.3 on the 
right) and designing. Some 
designs are part of the cloth, 
while others are printed after 
the cloth is woven. Finally, 
there are endless variations 
in the colours, which are 
produced from many kinds 
of pigments. 
The sari has a long history.

several travellers to India marvelled at its simplicity, 
economy, and the diverse ways in which it is worn. In 
addition, women often put the sari to many uses beyond 
that of a dress; the six pictures in Fig. 8.4 above illustrate a 
few such creative uses.

been used for?

can you draw?

Festivals Galore
There is an immense variety of festivals in India. You may 
have noticed that a few common ones are celebrated across 
India almost at the same time, though they have different 
names. We will take just one example — Makara Sankrānti, 
which marks the beginning of the harvest season in many

Æ During October–November, many major festivals take 
place in India. Make a list of the few main ones and their 
various names in different parts of the country. 

An Epic Spread
Literature offers us another fine illustration of unity in 
diversity. Indian literatures are extremely diverse (and 
among the most abundant in the world). Over centuries, 
despite differences in language, technique, etc., they have 
shared important themes and concerns. Who has not 
heard of the Pañchatantra, for example? This collection 
of delightful stories, with animals as the main characters, 
teaches us important life skills. The original Sanskrit text is 
at least 2,200 years old, but its stories have been adapted in 
almost every Indian language. In fact, they have travelled 
well beyond India, all the way to Southeast Asia, the Arab Epic:  
world and Europe, inspiring new collections of stories on A long poem 
the way — it is estimated that about 200 adaptations of generally 

the Pañchatantra exist in more than 50 languages! This narrating the 
adventures 

illustrates how ‘one’ collection of stories has become ‘many’. of heroes and 
other great 

The most striking case, however, is that of India’s two epics figures of the 
— the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata. past.

These two long Sanskrit poems, which together might fill 
some 7,000 pages in their original versions, narrate the 
stories of heroes who fight to re-establish dharma. In the 
Mahābhārata, the Pāṇḍavas, with Kṛiṣhṇa’s help, fight 
their own cousins, the Kauravas, to recover their kingdom. 
In the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāma, with the help of his brother 
Lakṣhmaṇa and of Hanuman, defeats the demon Rāvaṇa, 
who had kidnapped his wife Sītā. These stories contain 
many shorter ones that focus on values, and constantly 
ask questions about what is right and what is wrong.

 Fig. 8.6. A painting depicting a major episode from the Rāmāyaṇa  
(18th century, Himachal Pradesh)

LET’S EXPLORE
In a class discussion, try to identify the episode depicted in 
the painting shown in Fig. 8.6 above and important details 
associated with it.

For more than two millenniums, these two epics have been 
translated or adapted into regional literatures in India 
and beyond. In addition, there are countless folk versions 
of them. A few years ago, a scholar conducted a survey in 
Tamil Nadu alone and counted “about a hundred versions 
[of the Mahābhārata] that have come down to us in folklore 
forms.” Imagine what the number might be for the whole 
of India!
In fact, many communities have their own versions of the 
Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata. They have also preserved 
legends connecting their own history with these epics. This 

134 is especially true of tribal communities in many parts of 

8_100724_v8.indd   134 11-Jul-24   4:25:14 PM

Our Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions



India, such as the Bhils, the Gonds, the 
Mundas and many more. Most tribes 
of India’s northeast and Himalayan 
regions, including Kashmir, have 
had their own version of one or the 
other of the two epics, or both. These 
tribal adaptations are transmitted 
orally, along with legends on how 
the heroes of the Rāmāyaṇa and the 
Mahābhārata (generally any or all of 
the five Pāṇḍavas, their wife Draupadī, 
but also sometimes their cousin and 
adversary Duryodhana) visited the

is hardly a place in the country which 
the epic heroes such as the Pandavas, did not visit according 
to folklores.” And the same may be said of the Rāmāyaṇa. 
Over the centuries, perhaps more than any other texts, 
these two epics created a dense web of cultural interactions 
across India and many parts of Asia. Another example of 
unity in diversity.
To further illustrate the theme of this chapter, we could 
have continued our journey and turned to more facets 
of Indian culture. For instance, in India’s classical arts, 
including classical architecture, both diversity and unity 
are easily noticeable. (You will study these fields through 
the Art Curricular Area.)  
In the end, we should remember that Indian culture 
celebrates diversity as an enrichment, but never loses sight 
of the underlying unity which nourishes that diversity. 135

8 – Unity in Diversity, or ‘Many in the One’



Before we move on ... 
Æ India offers immense diversity in its landscapes, people, 

languages, dresses, foods, festivals and customs.
Æ Diversity is easy to perceive in many fields, but there is also an 

underlying unity. 
Æ India’s unity celebrates diversity because diversity does not 

divide — it enriches.

Questions, activities and projects 
1. Conduct a class discussion on the two quotations at the start of 

the chapter.
2. Read the National Anthem and its translation in the preliminary 

pages of this textbook. Where do you see the diversity? And 
where the unity? Write two or three paragraphs on this.

3. Select a few stories from the Pañchatantra and discuss how their 
message is still valid today. Do you know of any similar stories 
from your region? 

4. Collect a few folk tales from your region and discuss their 
message. 

5. Is there any ancient story that you have seen being depicted 
through a form of art? It could be a sculpture, a painting, a 
dance performance, a movie … Discuss with your classmates.

6. Discuss in class the following quotation by India’s first prime 
minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, when he travelled to many parts of 
India before Independence:

“Everywhere I found a cultural background which had 
exerted a powerful influence on their lives. … The old epics 
of India, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and other 
books, in popular translations and paraphrases, were widely 
known among the masses, and every incident and story and 
moral in them was engraved on the popular mind and gave 
a richness and content to it. Illiterate villagers would know 
hundreds of verses by heart and their conversation would 
be full of references to them or to some story with a moral, 

136 enshrined in some old classic.”

Questions 2. What is a community and what

Family
Almost all of us live in a family. The family is the fundamental 
and most ancient unit of any society. In Indian society today, 
there are several types of families — from joint families 
to nuclear families. A joint family has several generations 
living together — grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts, 

Examples of joint families 137

Examples of nuclear families

brothers, sisters and cousins. A nuclear family, on the 
other hand, is limited to a couple and their children, and 
sometimes one parent and children.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ What types of families do you see in your neighbourhood? 

List the type with the number of households for each type. 
Æ What types are more frequent? Why do you think this is so?
Æ As a class activity, compare with your classmates’ findings 

and discuss.

In English, there are not many terms to describe family 
relationships; we saw some of them in the first paragraph. 
Indian languages have many more terms. For example, 
in Hindi there is bua, tau, tai, chacha, mausi, nana, nani, 
and many more. Some languages, such as Tamil, also have 
different terms for elder brother / sister or younger brother 
/ sister. But what is the word for ‘cousin’ in an Indian 
language? In most Indian languages, you will find that there 
is no such word! That is because cousins are only ‘brothers’ 
and ‘sisters’. This emphasises the deep bonds among all the 

138 children in the family.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ  Make a list of all the members of your family you can think 

of, including a few distant relatives. List their terms in your 
mother tongue or regional language and try to find the 
equivalent in English. Two examples are below for Hindi:

Name Term in 
Hindi Description / term in English

mother's brother’s daughter 
Rani बहन (cousin) (among other possible 

meanings)
Sameer चाचा father's younger brother (uncle)

Æ Notice how, quite often, a single word in your mother 
tongue or regional language requires several words in 
English to give a precise definition.

Roles and Responsibilities 
Relationships among family members are based on love, 
care, cooperation and interdependence. ‘Cooperation’ 
means ‘working together’. Each member of the family 
has a role and responsibility towards other members. For 
instance, parents are responsible for raising their children 
to become happy individuals and responsible members of 
the society. But also, as children grow up, they take on more 
responsibilities in the home to help other family members 
— whether parents or a sister or a brother, etc. Through 
daily practice, children learn to participate in the life of the 
household. In many homes, children also learn some of the 
traditions and practices their family has been following for 
generations.

LET’S EXPLORE
Answer these questions and compare your answers with a  
few classmates:
Æ Who in your family decides what is to be bought from  

the market?
Æ Who cooks food in your home?
Æ Who is the oldest person in your family?
Æ Who cleans the floor in your home? 
Æ Who washes utensils in your house?
Æ Who helps you to do your homework?

Following our dharma, or doing our duty, has been an 
important principle of Indian culture. The family is also 
a ‘school’, where children learn important values such as 
ahimsa, dāna (giving), sevā (service) and tyāga (sacrifice). 
Individuals in the family often give up their own needs to 
take care of the family’s needs. 
Let us see one such story.

Shalini lives with her family in a town in Kerala. Her father runs 
a small business and her mother is a teacher in a nearby school. 

140 Shalini has a younger brother. Her grandmother, Acchamma

(father’s mother), Chittappa (father’s brother or paternal uncle) 
and her Chitti (aunt or uncle’s wife) live with them. They have a 
daughter, Shalini’s cousin, who she calls Chinni. Shalini’s uncle 
has just lost his job and her aunt is a homemaker. The whole 
family was preparing for the festival of Onam. Acchamma told 
Shalini’s father that his brother was having financial difficulties, 
so they were not able to buy new 
clothes for the festival. When Shalini’s 
parents took her and her brother 
shopping, they bought new clothes 
not only for themselves, but also for 
Chittappa, Chitti and Chinni. As a 
result, Shalini did not get the silk dress 
she had expected; she had to settle 
for a simple cotton one. Acchamma 
explained to Shalini that this is how 
families support each other and share 
what they have. Shalini did not mind 
her simpler dress. She was happy that 
everyone could get some new clothes.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Draw a simple tree of this family of seven members.
Æ Why do you think Shalini’s parents bought clothes  

for everyone?
Æ What would you have done if you were in Shalini’s place?

That story was set in Kerala. Let us now travel northeast, to 
a village in Meghalaya.

My name is Tenzing. I love the mountains we live in, though 
life is sometimes hard. My father runs a small grocery 
store. After my mother became busy in a local handicraft 
cooperative, making our beautiful traditional fabrics, 
wood carvings and other items for sale to tourists, my father joined 
in cleaning the house, taking care of our small vegetable garden 141

and other household chores. 
Often, he helps my grandmother 
prepare food for us all. 
Grandmother always has all sorts 
of interesting stories to tell me, 
with humour and wisdom; no 
one seems to understand people 
better than her! Grandfather 
helps me with my homework 
and takes me to the school bus 
stop. He is also actively involved 
in social work in our colony 
and is always offering his help 
to others. For example, when 
there is a power failure in our 
area, he goes and registers a 
complaint at the nearby office. 
When our neighbours’ house got 
damaged in a storm, he collected 
some money from the whole 
neighbourhood to help with 
repairs. 
We are lucky that my parents 

can take care of our basic necessities like food and clothing. 
When any special expenses come up, I have often seen that they 
discuss them together. Mother says that we should always try to 
save some money for any unexpected needs that may arise in the 
future.

THINK ABOUT IT
 Why does Tenzing’s father consult his wife for special 

expenses?
 How do you feel about his participation in household 

chores?
 What roles do the grandparents fulfil?

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Create a story of a family somewhere in India, where we 

see some family values practised. Share it with your class 
either through writing or drawing. 

Æ Stage a small drama with all your classmates around two 
or three families. The play you write could include some 
challenging situations that the families faced, and show 
how they are resolved.

Æ In the stories of Shalini and Tenzing, we see examples of 
joint families. What do you think are the aspects of modern 
living that make some couples opt for a nuclear family (i.e., 
living apart from older generations or other relatives)? 
What could be some advantages as well as disadvantages 
of the two kinds of families?

Community
Families are connected not only within themselves, but 
also with other families and the people around them. Such 
a group of connected people may be called a ‘community’ 
(there are other meanings for ‘community’, depending on 
the context). Members of a community come together for 
various reasons, like celebrating festivals and organising 
feasts, weddings and other events. In some villages, people 
come together to support each other with agricultural 
practices like land preparation, sowing and harvesting. 
Over time, communities often agreed upon some practices 
on the use of shared natural wealth and resources such 
as water, grazing lands and forest produce. This is the case 
with many tribal communities.  To some extent, this remains 
the case in village communities in rural India today. Such 
practices — we may call them ‘rules’, though they were 
rarely written down — have provided communities a secure 
access to resources. But it also means that all families and 

143

9_100724_v4.indd   143 11-Jul-24   5:04:21 PM

individuals within the community have specific duties 
to perform. Otherwise, the community will not function 
smoothly.

DON’T MISS OUT
 Year after year, the region around the town of Jhabua, 

in Madhya Pradesh, suffered from an acute water crisis. 
Following their halma (see facing page) tradition of coming 
together to support any individual or family in times of 
crisis, the Bhil community decided to plant thousands of 
trees in hundreds of villages. The Bhils also dug many 
trenches to conserve rainwater and created other water 
harvesting structures. They did not get paid for this work 
but did it as their duty towards their community and 
the environment. In the halma tradition, the objective is 
to serve Mother Earth. In 2019, Shri Mahesh Sharma of 
the Shivganga movement was honoured with the Padma 
Shri award for his transformational work with the Bhil 
communities. 

 During the Chennai floods of 2015, roads turned to rivers 
and people could no longer move around. Almost all 
shops were closed and services interrupted. Many private 
groups, in particular spiritual and religious organisations, 
cooked large quantities of food and distributed it to people 
who needed it. 

 There are many more such examples of people coming 
together to do something for the benefit of the community 
without expecting anything in return. Have you heard  
of any?

The real-life stories above illustrate community in a rural 
context. Community is also present in an urban context, 
although it may function a little differently. Let us see an 
example from another real-life story.

More than 20 years ago, in an area of Ahmedabad (Gujarat), 
Kamal Parmar, owner of a small auto-fabrication workshop, 
noticed a group of underprivileged children on the street. 
Some had dropped out of school, while others had never 
been to school. Kamal started giving them tuition from 5:30 
to 9:30 pm every day, after his regular work hours. He also 
provided the kids with a free dinner. Soon, 150 children 
were attending those classes regularly and were deeply 
interested in the lessons! 
A few teachers from a local school noticed the classes and 
joined the teaching for a while. One of them observed, “These 
children don’t get proper benches to sit on, have no ‘silence 
zone’ classrooms and the vehicles passing by make lots of 
noise, yet they pay all their attention to what the teachers 
tell them. This touched my heart. The love and affection I 
got from them was unbelievable.” Some older children who 
were attending regular schools also joined as volunteers to 
teach in Kamal’s classes. One of them remarked, “We went 
there to teach, instead we learnt a lot from them.”

 Discuss this story in your class. What kind of attitude 
towards the community does it reveal?

 What values get reflected in Kamal Parmar’s 
initiative?

 Think about those underprivileged children. Do you

 What should society do to make sure that all children 
get access to education? 

New types of communities have also emerged in the last 30 
or 40 years. Residents’ Welfare Associations in many urban 
areas are examples of communities that make their own 
rules and regulations. Those could be rules about waste 
management, cleanliness of common areas, taking care of 
pets, and so on. People living in the community participate 
in making such rules and regulations. 
Communities are ultimately interdependent. The same 
Residents’ Welfare Associations, for instance, will depend 
on the trading community for supplies and also on municipal 
workers to handle waste. In our complex societies, everyone 
depends on a number of other people and communities.

CHAPTER

10 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 1



Introduction 
Human beings have been living in communities for a long 
time. When a large number of people live together, there 
can be disagreements and disorder, and rules become 
necessary to maintain order and harmony in the society. 
There are probably some simple rules at home that you are 
expected to follow. The school where you study has rules too 
— some for students, others for teachers. In higher classes, 
students appearing for examinations must follow certain 
rules. Drivers on the road are expected to obey traffic rules. 
People employed in all kinds of jobs also need to follow the 
rules set by their employer, while the employers must also 
follow rules which they have committed to their employees.
What would happen if no one followed those rules? A 
simple answer is that society would not be able to function. 

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Describe the two pictures given in Fig. 10.1 on page 151 — 

what differences do you see between them?
Æ How do you connect this with our discussion on rules?
Æ What are some of the rules in your school? Who made 

them?

Who makes the rules and why? How are they made? These 
are some of the questions we will explore in this chapter. 
The process of taking decisions, organising the society’s 
life with different sets of rules, and ensuring that they are 
followed, is called governance. The group of individuals 
or the system that makes the rules and ensures that they 
are followed is called a government. Some of the more 
important rules are called laws.
This does not mean that rules and laws are set once and for 
all. Just as you might discuss a particular rule at home with 

150 your parents, or as a student body might ask the school or

university management to change a rule, citizens also have 
a say in the laws and rules governing the society. We will 
see how this takes place.

Three Organs of Government
All over the world, digital technologies have been 
transforming the way societies function. In India, till about 
30 years ago, people who wanted to transfer money to a 
distant relative would have to queue up at the Post Office to 
send a money order after filling up a form; or if they had to 
send a payment to some business, they would queue up at 
their bank to obtain a demand draft, which would then have 
to be sent by post. You have probably never heard these 
terms (‘money order’ or ‘demand draft’), because today we 
have digital means of sending across money instantly! 
However, this has also created a new class of criminals 
who, without even leaving their desks, find digital ways of 
stealing people’s money. This has led many governments 
to pass new laws in order to fight such criminal activities 
(called ‘cybercrime’). Some of those criminals, who believe 
in robbing innocent people of their hard-earned money 
instead of using their skills to contribute to the society, 
have been arrested and convicted in court. They are usually 
fined as well as jailed for some years.
Through this example, we can see how the three branches 
or ‘organs’ of a government work together:
 The legislature is the organ that makes new laws (or 

‘legislates’). Sometimes it also updates or removes 
153

10-100724_v4.indd   153 11-Jul-24   3:59:01 PM

10 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 1



existing laws. This is done by an assembly of represen-
tatives of the people. We will soon see how the Indian 
system works.

 The executive is the organ that implements (or 
‘executes’) the laws. This includes the head of state 
(who may be a president, a prime minister or a chief 
minister), the ministers and any agency responsible for 
enforcing ‘law and order’. (In our example above, that 
agency is the cyber police.)

 The judiciary is the system of courts which decides 
whether someone has broken the law and, if so, what 
course of action should be taken, including punishment 
if necessary. Sometimes it also examines whether a 
decision taken by the executive is right, or whether a 
law passed by the legislature is well conceived and fair 
to all. 

LET’S EXPLORE
Explain how the three government organs are at work in 
the case of the cybercriminals described above. How do they 
intervene?

In any good system of governance, 
these three organs must be 
kept separate, although they 
interact with each other 
and work together. This 
separation is called the Governance
‘separation of powers’ 
(Fig. 10.3). It is intended 
to provide a system of 
checks and balances. This Executive
means that each organ of the 
government can check what the 
other is doing and restore balance if Fig. 10.3

154 one organ acts beyond its expected role.

As a class activity, can you imagine the sort of disorder we 
might witness if all three organs were under the control of 
the same group of people? Can you describe any such real-life 
situation you may have heard of?

Three Levels of Government
Any government operates at two levels at the least — 
local and national. In many countries, including India, it 
functions at three levels or tiers — local, state or regional, 
and national. Each level deals with different matters. To 
use a comparison, if a bulb in your home is not lighting up, 
you will first check the bulb, switch, fuse, etc. If that does 
not work, you may call an electrician, and if it is found that 
the problem is not within your home, you may need to go 
to the Electricity Board and file a complaint. These are also 
three levels of dealing with a problem.

In India, we have local governments, State governments, 
and Central or Union government (Fig. 10.4 on page 155). 
Imagine that following heavy rain for a few days, there is a 
flood in a part of a district. If it is not too severe, the local 
authorities may be able to deal with it. If it involves several 
towns and many villages, the State Government will step in 
and send rescue teams to help affected people. But if it’s a 
massive flood affecting vast areas, the Central Government 
may also come to help by sending relief supplies, the army, 
etc. These are the three levels again.

DON’T MISS OUT
Many of our institutions have mottos inspired by the wisdom 
of our ancient texts. The Government of India’s motto, for 
example, is Satyameva Jayate, which means “Truth alone 
triumphs”. The Supreme Court’s motto is Yato Dharmastato 
Jayah, or, “Where there is dharma, there is victory.” 

The table on the facing page provides in summary a general 
framework of the main functions of the government’s 
three organs at the national and State levels. Their details 
(including the precise role of the assemblies) will be 
studied in greater depth in Grade 7. (Local government is 
not mentioned here as we will look at it more closely in the 
next two chapters.)

Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
Born in a humble family in Rameswaram, Tamil 
Nadu, in 1931, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a 
renowned scientist, nicknamed the ‘Missile Man 
of India’ for his crucial role in the development 
of India’s space programme, missile programme 
and nuclear capabilities.
Dr. Abdul Kalam served as the 11th President 
of India from 2002 to 2007. Despite his high 
status, he remained deeply connected to the 

people, and the youth in particular, through his passion for good 
education and innovation. He inspired millions with his humility, 
dedication to social causes and commitment to the nation. He 
tirelessly encouraged young Indians to dream big and work hard 
to achieve their goals.
Dr. Kalam showed that even though his position as the President 
of India was nominal, he could play an important role, impacting 
countless lives.
Let us meditate on a few of his inspiring thoughts:

Governance and Democracy s Democracy 



Democracy
You may have noticed that we earlier mentioned 
‘representatives of the people’. This is one of the foundation 
stones of the system of governance adopted by most countries 
of the world — democracy. The word ‘democracy’ comes 
from two Greek words — dēmos meaning ‘people’, and 
kratos meaning ‘rule’ or ‘power’; so ‘democracy’ literally 
means the ‘rule of the people’. 
But can all people actually rule? It is clearly not possible. 
Imagine there is a problem that your class wants to bring 
to the attention of your school’s principal — maybe there is 
something wrong with the classroom, or with the school’s 
infrastructure, or perhaps you would like to propose a 
certain date for a field trip. Will the entire class go to the 
principal? It would clearly not be practical. In many schools, 
classes have a ‘class monitor’ or ‘class representative’, 
whom the whole class elected; even if there is none, one 
representative can be selected for this specific purpose. It 
will be enough to send the representative to the principal. 
It is the same principle at the State or national levels ̶ 
through elections, people vote for representatives, who will 
be the elected members of their respective assemblies. They 
are generally called ‘Members of Legislative Assembly’ 
(or MLAs) at the State level, and ‘Member of Parliament’ 
(or MPs) at the national level. 
All these members discuss laws, 
problems and solutions in the 
assemblies, and, through dialogue 
and debate, try to convince each 
other whenever there are different 
opinions.
Like any modern democracy, 
therefore, India is a representative 
democracy. It is also the world’s 

159

largest democracy, with some 970 million voters in 2024! 
In principle, all Indian citizens above the age of 18 have the 
right to participate in these elections.
Imagine that your class is planning to go for a picnic. There 
are two possible places, A and B. The class discusses the 
pros and cons — distance, time, cost, availability of basic 
facilities, etc. It becomes difficult to arrive at a decision. 
So your teacher decides that voting can solve the problem. 
The number of students in favour of place A raise their 
hands, then the number of students in favour of place B 
raise theirs. The decision is taken by whichever option gets 
a larger number of raised hands. (This process is called 
voting.) This is a case of direct democracy where every 
student’s opinion was taken to finalise the place.
The term grassroots democracy refers to a system that 
enables and encourages the participation of ordinary 
citizens — the base of the pyramid we saw in Fig. 10.4 on 
page 155. In such a system, the citizens can have a say in 
decisions which affect them. 
We will study more features of Indian democracy in the 
next two chapters and also in later grades.

Before we move on ...
Æ No country can run without governance and government.
Æ A modern government has three organs — legislative, 

executive and judiciary — which need to work together.
Æ The Indian government functions at three levels — Centre 

or national, State and local.
Æ Democracy is the overall framework for this system. It 

functions through elected representatives, both at the State 
and the national levels.

Questions 2. What are their functions? 

3. Why are they important in

Let us now see how the government functions at the local 
level. In this chapter, our focus will be on local government in 
rural areas; we will move to urban areas in the next chapter. 
India is a country of enormous size and diversity. We have 
about 600,000 villages, 8,000 towns and over 4,000 cities. 
Our population has crossed 1.4 billion, almost two-thirds of 
which live in rural areas. How do we govern ourselves in this 
complex society? 
Let us take a trip to Lakshmanpur, a small village in the 
foothills of the Himalayas. It has 200 houses and a population 
of about 700, most of whom are farmers. People cultivate 

163

11 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 2



their lands and rear cows or goats. Some have relatives 
serving in the armed forces; a few younger villagers have 
migrated to the city in search of jobs. What are the needs 
of this village — maybe water for the fields, repairing the 
main road if it got damaged by heavy rains, or maintaining 
the village’s primary school? How will the villagers take 
decisions about such matters that affect their daily lives? 
And where will they get the resources to meet those needs? 
What will happen if there is a dispute about land or if some 
of the crop is stolen? Many such questions can arise in a 
village. Can people run to the State or the national capital 
for every such issue?
Panchayati Raj System
Like every village in India, the Lakshmanpur people have 
a system of local government called ‘Panchayat’, which 
refers to a village council. Panchayats bring governance 
closer to the people, making it possible for them to actively 
participate in decision-making processes. That is why 
the Panchayat system, also known as Panchayati Raj, is 
a form of self-government. Panchayats play a vital role 
in addressing local issues, promoting development and 
ensuring that the benefits of government schemes reach 
the grassroots level.

Governance and Democracy



As is clear from the diagram, the Panchayati Raj system 
works at three levels — from bottom up — the village, the 
block and the district. This is called a ‘three-tier system’. 
Together, these institutions’ responsibilities cover almost 
all aspects of life in the district, from agriculture, housing, 
maintenance of roads, management of water resources, 
education, health care and social welfare to cultural 
activities.

Gram Panchayat
Let us begin with the base of Fig. 11.1 on page 164 — the Gram 
Panchayat, which is closest to the people in rural areas. Its 
members are elected directly by the Gram Sabha, which is 
a group of adults from a village (or group of neighbouring 
villages) who are enrolled as voters. In the Gram Sabha, 
women and men discuss all matters related to their area 
and take decisions. Each Gram Panchayat elects a head 
or president called the ‘Sarpanch’ or ‘Pradhan’. In recent 
years, more and more women have become Sarpanchs.

165

11_100724_v5.indd   165 11-Jul-24   4:27:21 PM

11 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 2



Exemplary Sarpanchs
Dnyaneshwar Kamble is a transgender person who was 
elected Sarpanch of Tarangfal village in the Solapur district of 
Maharashtra in 2017. Kamble’s motto is lok seva, gram seva, 

that is, ‘Service to the village is service to 
the public.’ Kamble defeated six other 

candidates to become the Sarpanch. 
Vandana Bahadur Maida, 
a member of the Bhil 
commu-nity from the 
village of Khankhandvi 
in Madhya Pradesh, defied 

patriarchal norms to become the first 
female Sarpanch of her village. She 
convinced women in the village to attend 
the Sabha meetings and addressed critical 
issues like education and sanitation, 
earning recognition far and wide. 
Vandana’s journey shows how women 
can play a leading role  in transforming 
rural India.

Hiware Bazar, a village in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, used 
to be affected by frequent droughts and poor agricultural yield. After 
Popatrao Baguji Pawar became its Sarpanch, he started applying 
Anna Hazare’s model of rainwater harvesting, watershed conservation 
and massive tree planting of lakhs of trees, all of which contributed to 
the recharge of groundwater. With the collaboration of the villagers, 
Hiware Bazar became a green and prosperous village in a few years. 

166 Shri Popatrao Pawar was awarded the Padma Shri in 2020.

11_100724_v5.indd   166 11-Jul-24   4:27:23 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond 
Governance and Democracy



The Gram Panchayat is assisted by a 
Panchayat Secretary who performs 
administrative functions such as 
calling meetings and maintaining 
records. Most Gram Panchayats are 
also assisted by an officer called 
‘Patwari’ in many parts of India, who 
maintains the villagers’ land records. 
In some cases, the Patwari keeps 
maps that are generations old! 

THINK ABOUT IT
How do you think can these old maps be helpful for us? 
Can they tell us something about the past and the present?

Child-Friendly Panchayat Initiative
Panchayats are supposed to listen to everyone’s voice 
— including the voice of children. The Child-Friendly 
Panchayat Initiative creates opportunities for children to 
express their ideas and opinions on matters that concern 
their wellbeing. Steps are being taken in several States to 
encourage the participation of children in Bal Sabhas and 
Bal Panchayats on a regular basis, while village elders try 
to find solutions to their concerns. 
In Maharashtra, for example, a few Bal Panchayats have 
worked to eliminate child labour and child marriage. 
They have brought many children back to school. The Bal 
Panchayat members get together to convince parents and 
other adults to send their wards back to school, and not to 
arrange marriages for girls who should be studying.
Several Gram Panchayats have won awards for taking 
child-friendly initiatives. Here’s an example from Sikkim:
Sangkhu Radhu Khandu Gram Panchayat, in west Sikkim, 
has given a lot of importance to children’s needs and rights. 

167

11_100724_v5.indd   167 11-Jul-24   4:27:24 PM

11 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 2



The Panchayat has built compound walls for schools to 
make them safer for children. To ensure that students get 
hygienically cooked midday meals, the Gram Panchayat has 
constructed kitchens in the schools. It is for these efforts 
that Sangkhu Radhu Khandu has been declared a child-
friendly Gram Panchayat.
Let us also look at another example from Rajasthan:
The ‘Children’s Parliament’, an offshoot of Bunker Roy’s 
‘Barefoot College’ initiative a few decades ago, empowered 
underprivileged children in Rajasthan’s rural areas 
through education and democratic participation. Children 
aged 8 to 14 are engaged in governance processes, learning 
about democracy and social responsibility through night 
schools and parliament-like elections. The ‘Parliament’ 
followed formal procedures, including voter ID cards 
and campaigning. Elected representatives formed a 
‘Cabinet’, overseeing school management and advocating 
for community needs. The initiative fostered leadership 
skills and social awareness, enabling children to challenge 
societal norms and advocate for change. Children actively 
addressed issues such as access to education, sanitation and 

168

11_100724_v5.indd   168 11-Jul-24   4:27:25 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond 
Governance and Democracy



social equality, contributing to community development. The 
Children’s Parliament initiative received many accolades, 
including the World’s Children’s Honorary Award in 2001.

LET’S EXPLORE
As a class activity, let four or five students form a Bal Panchayat 
and the rest of the class imagine they are the villagers. What 
issues will the Gram Sabha discuss? What challenges could it 
encounter? What solutions will it propose?

Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad
Similar institutions exist at the block level and the district 
level, which are above the village level. Their names are 
listed in the pyramidal diagram we saw in Fig. 11.1 on page 
164. The Panchayat Samiti at the block level is the link 
between the Gram Panchayat and the Zila Parishad at the 
district level. The members of these institutions are elected 
by the local people, but they may have other members like 
Sarpanchs of the villages in the area and local members of 
the State Legislative Assembly. 
The composition of the Panchayat Samitis differs from State 
to State, but their role in strengthening the participation 
of local people remains the same. They coordinate matters 
across Gram Panchayats, for instance, by collecting 
development plans from all Gram Panchayats and putting 
them together to present them at the District or State levels 
respectively. This facilitates the allotment of funds for such 
development projects and for government schemes such as 
the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, which promotes 
the construction of all-weather roads in rural areas.
At all the three levels, special rules have been made so that 
disadvantaged sections of the population can make their 
needs and problems heard. These institutions also have a 
provision for reserving one-third of the seats for women.

169

THINK ABOUT IT
Why do you think it is important for the government 
to pay more attention to the needs and problems of the 
disadvantaged sections of society?

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ What similarities and differences do you notice between the 

governance system at the Central level and at the Panchayat 
level? (Hint: refer back to Chapter 10 if required.)

Æ If you get an opportunity to meet a few Panchayat members, 
what questions would you like to ask them? Discuss in 
small groups to create a questionnaire. Meet some Gram 
Panchayat members or invite them to your school. Ask them 
the questions in your questionnaire and write a short report.

Let us remember that the structure and functions of 
the Panchayati Raj institutions differ a little across 
States. This is because the States have authority over 
those institutions. But their objectives are the same 
— it is to enable villagers to take an active part in the 
management and development of their villages and 
the local area. 

The Arthaśhāstra is an ancient text of governance written 
by Kauṭilya (later also known as Chāṇakya) some 2,300 
years ago. Among other things, it describes how a state 
should be structured and run, how the economy can be 
made prosperous, what the duties of the ruler are and 
how to conduct war. Kauṭilya, an expert in statecraft, also 
explains how a whole administrative structure should be 
put in place from the village to the regional capital:

170

11_100724_v5.indd   170 11-Jul-24   4:27:27 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond 
Governance and Democracy



“The king shall establish a sangrahaṇa (a sub-district head 
quarters) for every 10 villages; a kārvaṭika (district headquarters) 
for every 100 villages; a droṇamukha for every 400 villages; and 
a sthānīya (provincial headquarters) for every 800 villages.” 

In today’s language, what are the names we would give these 
four categories? Is it not amazing that a similar structure was 
thought of so long ago?

Before we move on ...
→ The local government in rural areas is organised into a 

three-tier system.
→ Democracy in the Panchayati Raj system works both 

through direct participation of people and through their 
elected representatives.

→ The Panchayati Raj institutions give people in rural areas 
a measure of self-governance, so they may manage their 
issues and collaborate in development plans.

Questions, activities and projects 
1. Test yourself — without looking at the text above, can you 

name the three tiers of the Panchayati Raj system? What 
are the key functions of each of the three tiers?

2. Write a letter to the Sarpanch regarding the issue of plastic 
bags lying on the roadside in the village. 

3. In your view, what type of person should be a Gram 
Panchayat member?

4. Let us suppose that you study in a village school. The 
school is located next to a highway and students find it 
difficult to cross the road when they come to school or 
leave at the end of the day. What are the options to solve 
this issue? Which institutions in the Panchayati Raj can 
help you? What can the students do?

CHAPTER

12 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 3



Introduction 
Earlier chapters have shown us how, 
in a democracy, good governance 
aims to empower the citizens so they 
may actively participate in their 
country’s functioning, whether it is 
at the rural, regional, urban, state 
or national level. This is the broader 
concept of participatory democracy. 
We saw the basics of the system in 
a rural context. Let us now see how 
it works in an urban scenario. Since 
the latter is generally more complex 

and diverse than the former, it is understandable that the 
urban governance system needs to be more complex too. 
We will however limit ourselves here to its basic principles.

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Why is a city like Kolkata, Chennai or Mumbai more complex 

and diverse than a village or a town?
Æ With your classmates, make a list of diverse communities 

residing in any city that you are familiar with. How many 
were you able to list? What else do you observe in the list?

Before we explore governance and administration in 
urban areas, it helps to take an overall look at the Indian 
system of governance, from rural to national, as depicted in 
Fig. 12.2 on page 175. The base of the pyramid is the local 
level, closer to the people, while the top is the national level. 
In Chapter 11, we explored the left side of the pyramid; we 
will now take a look at the right side.

LET’S EXPLORE
In Fig. 12.2 above, what similarities and differences do you 
notice between the Panchayati Raj system and the urban local 
government?

Urban Local Bodies
Local government structures in urban areas are called 
‘urban local bodies’. They are decentralised, which means 
that instead of operating under a central authority at the 175

top, the local communities have a direct say on how their 
areas are managed or the issues they face. It is a mechanism 
for citizens living in an area to come together and take 
decisions about what is best for them. 
Cities and towns are divided into smaller units called 
‘wards’, and the ward committees facilitate activities 
such as conducting health camps, organising a campaign 
against the use of single-use plastics, and so on. They also 
keep an eye on anything that might go wrong — a water 
leak, a blocked drain, a damaged road, etc. — and report 
such problems to the authorities. However, the precise 
functioning of wards differs from State to State, depending 
on the rules they make.

Altogether, urban local bodies are responsible for a range 
of functions — helping take care of the infrastructure, 
maintaining the burial ground, garbage collection and 
disposal, checking the implementation of government 
schemes, collecting local taxes and fines, and so on. They 
also have some role in planning for the area’s economic 

176 and social development. However, for these bodies to be 

12_100724_v3.indd   176 11-Jul-24   5:01:46 PM

Exploring Society: India and Beyond  
Governance and Democracy



able to perform their functions efficiently, people living in 
the city must also perform their duties, which means that 
they must show care and concern for their area (remember, 
this is a participatory democracy). For instance, if people 
carefully follow instructions regarding waste segregation, 
garbage collection becomes easier; or if they notice a water 
leakage in a street, reporting it promptly will prevent 
further wastage of precious water. 

LET’S EXPLORE
Can you think of four or five more actions that responsible 
citizens might take to help their area of the city?

Fig. 12.3. The Madras Corporation

The Madras Corporation (now Greater Chennai Corporation), 
established on 29 September 1688, is the oldest municipal 
institution in India. The East India Company issued a charter 
the previous year constituting the town of ‘Fort St. George’ and 
all territories within 16 km from the Fort into a corporation. A 
Parliamentary Act of 1792 gave the Madras Corporation power 
to levy municipal taxes in the city, which is when the municipal 
administration properly began.

   THINK ABOUT IT
Indore in Madhya Pradesh has been awarded the cleanest 
city in India under the Swachh Survekshan government 
scheme for seven years in a row. What could have been the 
role of Indore citizens in this achievement?

As we see, Chennai and Indore have a Municipal Corpo-
ration at the top of their urban bodies. Only cities with a 
population above 10 lakhs have a Municipal Corporation 
(also called ‘Mahanagar Nigam’) as their highest body. 
Between 1 and 10 lakhs, the highest body is a Municipal 
Council (also called ‘Nagar Palika’). Cities and towns with 
smaller populations have a Nagar Panchayat. 

LET’S EXPLORE
Æ Select a few cities, from your State and from a few 

neighbouring States. These may include the city you 
live in or the city nearest to your town or village. How will 
you find out if they have a Nagar Panchayat, Municipal 
Council or Municipal Corporation? Draw a table with the 
names of the cities and the type of urban local body each 
of them has. 

Æ How do urban local bodies fund their activities? (Hint: 
Look carefully at the pictures of the functions performed by 
Indore Municipal Corporation in Figure 12.4 on page 178.) 
Are some of them paid services?

Sameer: Hello! I haven’t seen you 
around here before. Are you new to 
this village?
Anita: Hello! Yes, I’m visiting my grand-
parents who live nearby. I am from the 
city. It’s quite different from here!
Sameer: Oh, really? What’s it like in 
the city? 179

12_100724_v3.indd   179 11-Jul-24   5:01:59 PM

12 ― Grassroots Democracy – Part 3



Anita: Well, it’s busy and crowded, with tall buildings everywhere. 
There are so many people rushing around all the time, and it’s 
noisy compared to the quietness here. Also, people are more 
independent and often don’t even know their neighbours. 
Sameer: Wow! Here, everyone knows everyone else and 
pitches in to help each other out — we work together in the 
fields, celebrate festivals together, and even make decisions as 
a community.

Anita: Well, there’s still some sense of 
community in the city. Just the other 
day, following heavy rains, a house 
collapsed two streets away. Dozens of 
people gathered from all over the place 
to help clear the rubble and make sure 
no one was trapped inside.
Sameer: Doesn’t the local government 
help in such cases?
Anita: Yes, it does. In fact, we have 

local bodies and elected representatives who represent us and 
our interests.
Sameer: Well, it sounds like our village Panchayat, only bigger. 
Members are elected, too, but because they all know each other, 
a lot more people can participate and discuss all kinds of issues 
that concern the village. Sometimes, even us kids can get heard.
Anita: Really? You are not making that up?

Sameer: Not at all! The other day a few kids noticed that an 
electricity wire was hanging dangerously low, almost touching 
the roof of a building. Not only did we report it, but we explained 
to one of our Gram Sabha members that an electric post should 
be shifted a little. And it was done! 
Anita: Great! I suppose that’s how democracy should work. It 
seems more complicated in the city, but the idea is the same — 
everyone’s voice matters.
Sameer: Yes, it does! Sorry, I must make a move. My mother needs 
my help for a little shopping. Thanks for telling me about the city. 
Anita: And thanks for telling me about your village! I am definitely 
going to look around.
Sameer: Well, maybe we’ll meet again sometime. Bye!

Before we move on …
→ In urban areas, decentralised governance works 

through different urban local bodies, which fulfil 
various functions affecting the citizens’ lives.

→ As with the rural context, urban local bodies have elected 
members who represent the local citizens.

→ The citizens also have duties to ensure that the local bodies 
are able to perform their functions efficiently.

Questions, activities and projects 
1. On your way to school, you and your friends notice that 

a water pipe is leaking. A lot of water is being wasted on 
account of the leak. What would you and your friends do 
in such a situation? 

2. Invite a member of an urban local body near you to your 
class. Discuss with them their role and responsibilities. 
Prepare a set of questions to ask them so that the meeting 
is fruitful.

14 ― Economic Activities Around Us



Over the decades, the number of economic activities has 
increased tremendously. For example, earlier most people 
were involved in activities such as agriculture, livestock 
rearing, production of tools, pottery and weaving cloth. 
As societies progressed, the number of economic activities 
through which people earn their livelihoods increased 
vastly.
Today, there are diverse economic activities such as 
manufacturing computers, mobile phones and drones; 
working in banks, schools and hotels; driving various types 
of vehicles for transportation; making furniture; tailoring 
clothes using machines; creating software; repairing 
refrigerators and washing machines; etc. Classifying all 
these activities helps us to understand how they function 
and the links they have with each other.

The Classification of Economic Activities

Sectors: 
Broad Some economic activities share similar characteristics and 

groups that 
include based on this, they can be grouped together or classified 
various into broader groups called economic sectors. The three

A. Primary activities
Those economic activities in which people are directly 
dependent on nature to produce goods are known as 
primary activities or primary sector economic activities. 

Primary sector:   
The group of activities that involves extraction of raw materials directly from 
nature such as farming, fishing, forestry, etc.

For example, work involving cultivation of grains and 
vegetables from agricultural farms, collecting wood from 
the forests, extracting coal from mines, fish from fisheries, 
eggs from poultry farms, etc., are all primary sector 
economic activities. 
The most common primary activities are agriculture, 
mining, fishing, raising livestock, forestry, etc. Below are

sector activities include the processing of grains obtained 
from agricultural fields to make flour in mills, extraction of 
oil from groundnut and processing of tea leaves to derive 
tea. Similarly, wood from the forest is converted into 
furniture and paper, cotton is used to make clothes, and 
steel from iron ore is used to make automobiles like cars, 
trucks, etc.

Interdependence Among Sectors
The three types of economic activities or economic sectors 
play an important role in the process of conversion of 
natural raw materials into finished products for final 
consumption. Let us go on an imaginary excursion to a 
village in Anand district of Gujarat to study an interesting 
example where we will understand how the three sectors 
are interconnected and support each other.

This is the amazing story of a milk cooperative named Anand 
Milk Union Limited (AMUL). In the early 1940s, farmers in 
Anand district would sell milk to the neighbouring villages.

They would have to cycle or walk to nearby villages to sell 
the milk under scorching heat. As you know, milk spoils or 
curdles very fast in hot weather. The farmers had to sell the 
milk quickly before it could spoil. This was a lot of effort 
for the small amount of money they would earn. So, they

Milk is then processed and converted from one form (liquid) 
into another — milk powder, ghee, cheese, butter and many 
others in the factories. These economic activities  are called 
secondary sector economic activities.

What does AMUL do with all the products it makes? It sells 
them in various places. AMUL uses lorries and trucks, as 
well as railway, air and shipping services, to transport its 
products. It has set up retail stores and supplies milk and 
milk products to other shops in towns, cities and villages 
all over Gujarat, as well as in different states across India. 
Here, transportation, trading and retail is a tertiary activity.

With the help of the images below, let’s see how the books 
you study are made. The images show the transformation 
of pulp (wooden fibre of a tree) into paper and, after 
printing, into textbooks.

None of the activities that were part of the process – from 
extracting pulp from the trees to making paper and finally 
producing the books would have been possible, had it not 
been for all three sectors working together.

 THINK ABOUT IT
Observe the different stages of the process shown in Fig. 14.1 
on page 206 and discuss them with your fellow classmates.

These days, used paper is recycled to make new paper. 
Recycling just one tonne of paper saves 17 trees as well as 2.5 
cubic metres of landfill space, where waste is dumped. It also 
takes 70 per cent less energy and water to recycle paper than 
to make new paper from wood pulp.

What are the different ways 
through which we can judiciously 
use paper in the classrooms and 

offices of your school?

Types of Economic Activities
Kavya was excited to go to her aunt’s house in the village of 
Kamlapur. On the way, she saw that a highway was being 
built near the village, and the construction site was abuzz 
with activity. Large machines, such as excavators and 
bulldozers, were being operated by dedicated technicians. 

This new highway promised to reduce 
the travel time to the nearest town 
from five hours to just two hours. 
Kavya thought that she would be able 
to visit her aunt more often once the 
highway was ready, since it would 
take less time to travel there. Happy 
with this thought, Kavya ran to greet 
her aunt and to eat the delicious 
jalebis that she had made. They were 
joined by Kavya’s uncle, who had 
just returned home from work. He 

is a technician in a construction company and operates a 
bulldozer. He receives a monthly salary for his services.
The next day, Kavya’s aunt woke up early to finish her 
share of the household chores and left for work. She is

paid a monthly salary. In the evening, after 
her office work, she also conducts online 
classes to help students prepare for school 
exams. She charges a weekly fee for these 
classes.
On the weekend, Kavya visited a local 
mango orchard with her aunt to have some 
delicious mangoes.

Let us take the example of Kavya’s father, Rajesh, to 
understand this.

Rajesh is a carpenter who buys 
wood from a nearby market for 
₹600 to make furniture.

He uses special tools and 
other materials for building the 
furniture.

Rajesh sells a chair for ₹1,000 
each in the market.

The wood for the chair costs ₹600. So, what is the remaining 
₹400 (₹1,000 – ₹600) for? It is the monetary value of Rajesh’s 
skill, time and effort, which went into making that chair. 
Rajesh has added value to the wood by turning it into 
furniture. From buying the wood to selling the chair, these 
activities involve payment. They are, therefore, a part of 

190 economic activities.

The Importance of Non-Economic 
Activities
While non-economic activities may not involve money, the 
value they generate is important in our lives.

Sevā: selfless service
We see sevā in many places such as temples, gurudwaras, 
mosques and churches. For instance, langars or community 
kitchens at gurudwaras serve food to every visitor for free. 
These practices foster a sense of satisfaction and gratitude

for what we have, and they are also a way of contributing 
to society without expecting anything in return.

The strength of community 
participation
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is 
based on the collective efforts 
of all Indian citizens to keep our 
surroundings clean. Individually, 
we keep our homes and surround-
ings clean. People have also come 
together to clean up streets, roads, 

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan parks and other public places 
or community areas. Together, 
these efforts lead to a clean home, 
neighbourhood, society and nation.
Another example of collective 
community participation is the 
celebration of Van Mahotsav (the 
festival of forests) in India to 
promote awareness about the 
value of trees and the conservation

of forests. The initiative brings together members of the 
community for tree plantation drives.

THINK ABOUT IT
 Many communities in India have similar practices that 

involve community participation. Can you identify a few 
from your area?

 We celebrate many festivals in India. During these 
festivals, people gather to organise all the various 
activities. They decorate the place together and share the 
food that they cook. Are these non-economic activities? 
Why do you think they still hold value?

 Can you identify community programmes that have been 
undertaken by your school or in your locality? What did 
you observe during these programmes?

Before we move on...
Æ In this chapter, we learnt about economic and non-

economic activities.
Æ We also learnt about the value addition that economic 

activities create.
Æ We understood how non-economic activities contribute to 

social welfare, personal wellbeing and enhance the overall 
quality of life.

Questions, activities and projects 
1. How are economic activities different from non-economic 

activities?
2. What kind of economic activities do people engage in? 

Illustrate with examples.
3. There is great value attached to people who are engaged in 

community service activities. Comment on this statement. 
4. What are the various ways in which people are 

compensated for various economic activities? Give some 
examples. 193
