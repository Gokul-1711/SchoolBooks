hard on your land and created this plantation. 
While you looked after the trees, your wife sold 
the fruits in the market. That’s how you got this

wealth, not magic. If I had told you about this

The Raven, who did not see the joke,
Forgot that his voice was just a croak.
He opened his beak, in his foolish pride–
And down fell the morsel the Fox had eyed.

Ignore sweet words that make you glow. 
Pride, my friend, is rather unwise; 
I’m sure this teaching is quite a surprise.”

 (ii) The mahout was a good caretaker because he gave _________ 
to Gajaraj and a ______ in the pond.

 (iii) What do you think is the difference between a friend and 
a caretaker?

 (b) “Are you missing your friend?” asked the farmer remembering the 
happy look on Buntee’s face while sitting on the elephant’s back. “I 
cannot see you go hungry,” said the farmer, “If you miss your friend 
so much, go to him.” The farmer removed the rope with which he had 
tied the dog.

 3. How did the mahout come to know that Gajaraj was sad? 
 4. Why do you think Buntee licked the farmer’s hand?
 5. What was ‘unlikely’ about the friendship of Gajaraj and Buntee? 

 Let us learn 
 1. Gajaraj was sad without a friend and when he met Buntee, he was filled 

with joy. ‘Sad’ and ‘filled with joy’ are opposites. Opposites can also be 
formed by adding some letters before a word. For example, un- unhappy, 
in- incorrect, dis- disconnect, mis- misuse.

  Now, take help from the words given as hints and fill up their opposites 
in the puzzle. (Note: All the words are from the story you have just read.)

had asked) Buntee why he was sad. Farmer ____________ (felt/was feeling/ 
had felt) that Buntee ____________ (missed/was missing/had missed) 
Gajaraj and set him free.

 4. ‘…neither the farmer nor the mahout noticed that the two friends were 
in tears.’ 

  The words ‘neither’, ‘nor’ are used to state that the farmer and the 
mahout did not notice the same thing. ‘Neither, nor’ connect two negative 
choices. For example: Neither Rohit nor I want to play football.

  When you need to choose between two things that you want, you may use 
‘either, or’. For example: Rohit wants to play either cricket or kho-kho. 
It means Rohit wants to play cricket or Rohit wants to play kho-kho. 
Discuss the given sentences with your teacher to practice.

had at school, and how he was so friendly with 
everyone.

One day his grandfather said to him, “Mario, 
I bet you a fruit chaat. You don’t have as many 
friends as you think you have. I’m sure many 
of them are nothing more than companions or 
partners.”

Mario accepted the bet readily. However, accepted: 
he wasn’t sure how he could test whether his agreed to
schoolmates were real friends or not. So, he readily: without 
asked his grandpa for help. He suggested, “I any problem
have exactly what you need. It’s in the attic. attic: a storage

Mario tried sitting on the chair. Having 
difficulty seeing it, he missed and fell straight 
onto his backside. His classmates had a pretty 
good laugh.

“Wait, wait, just a slight technical 
problem,” he said, trying again. But again, 
he missed the seat, causing more surprised 
looks and laughter. Mario wouldn’t give up. 
He kept trying to sit on the magic chair and 
kept falling to the ground until, suddenly, he 
tried again and didn’t fall. This time he sat, 
hanging in mid-air.

enjoying each and every fall.

Leaving with his three friends, he explained to them how 
his grandfather had so cleverly thought of a way to show him 
that true friends are those who care for us. A friend wouldn’t be 
someone who takes joy in our bad luck.

That evening the four children went to see Mario’s grandpa 
as he had won the bet. They had a great time listening to stories 
and eating a lot of fruit chaat. From then on, they used the magic 
chair test on many occasions and whoever passed became friends 
for life.

say that the cow took care of the leopard cub like a mother. 
When the cub became older, it went away from the village. 
It returned to meet the cow at night. The villagers were 
worried but they never stopped the leopard. They saw that 
the leopard just sat beside the cow quietly. The cow and 
leopard spent time by relaxing and playing with each other. 
The leopard did not like the villagers and stopped coming 
regularly. The villagers were surprised that the leopard 
never attacked the cow but became its friend.

I lived	first	in	a	little	house,
And lived there very well,
I thought the world was small and round,
And made of pale, blue shell.

I lived next in a little nest,
Nor needed any other,
I thought the world was made of straw,
And nestled by my mother.

One	day,	I	fluttered	from	my	nest,
To	see	what	I	could	find,
I said the world is made of leaves,
I have been very blind.

At	length	I	flew	beyond	the	tree,
Quite	fit	for	grown-up	labours,
I don’t know how the world is made,
And neither do my neighbours.

 3. Do you know if these spices can be used for something else other than 
cooking?	Let	us	find	out	by	reading	the	letter	given	below.	

Dear Vikram and Vaibhavi,
Namaste! I just got your message that you are better now. 
I am happy that the natural cures that I had shared, helped you. You should 
try to remember these cures and may share them with your friends. When 
I	was	a	child,	 I	 learnt	 them	from	my	grandmother.	She	used	 to	find	home	
remedies for most of the weather-related common illnesses. Let me share 
some	of	the	benefits	of	the	spices	that	most	of	us	have	in	our	kitchen.	
Let me start with haldi, which is called turmeric in English. It helps in improving 
our energy level and digestion. It helps in reducing body pain too. 
Next, let us take methi, which is called fenugreek in English. You will be 
surprised to know that it helps me in keeping my sugar level and my body 
weight in control. I need to soak the methi seeds overnight and drink the water 
in the morning. 
•	 Jeera (cumin) seeds soaked in water overnight can also improve digestion and 

help cure sleeplessness.
• You know, when you were babies and had gas in your tummy, I used to put 

heeng (asafoetida) water on your tummy to give you some relief. Heeng 
can also help in controlling cough and cold. 

• Dalchini (cinnamon) and laung (clove) give relief when we have toothache 
till we can consult a dentist.

• Adrak (ginger) is another herb that can help us when we have cough and 
cold.  It also gives relief from pain. Do you know, ginger has been used for 
cooking for more than 4000 years? Even today, it is extensively used in 
cooking Indian food.

•		 Kali mirch (black pepper) is also helpful in digestion and can give us relief 
from body pain. 

•	 You may have seen that at the end of a meal, saunf (fennel seeds) and 
ajwain (carom seeds) are served. It is because they help in the digestion of 
food.

•	 Elaichi (cardamom) also helps us with digestion and respiratory troubles 
in addition to curing bad breath.

The wonder herb: Tulsi is a shrub in the basil family. It is said that it was 
first	found	in	north	central	India	and	now	grows	almost	everywhere	in	
India. It is known as ‘the Queen of Herbs’ and has many medicinal uses. 
Studies show that it helps to decrease glucose and cholesterol levels 
and improve blood pressure. It is commonly used to treat breathing 
and digestion disorders. As it has anti-bacterial properties, it is used 
in herbal hand sanitisers. It is used as a base for making herbal mouth 
wash and toothpaste for treating bad breath, gum disease and mouth 
ulcers. 

Tulsi leaves can be washed and eaten raw. We can also add Tulsi 
leaves when we make tea. Tulsi tea helps in dealing with stress as it calms 
our mind. Tulsi protects us from a vast range of pollutants around us.

to change the scoreboard while his opponent

Prabhat kept a close watch on Surya for kept a close 
some days. He was great at some things, watch on: 
terrible at others but what was common was observed
the enjoyment. He enjoyed everything equally. 
As Prabhat went on with his observation, he 
realised that to enjoy a game, you did not need 
a scoreboard to keep a tally of your scores. 
Neither did you have to worry about winning 
and losing. You needed to enjoy the game for 
its own sake. What matters is trying to do well, 
and enjoying every moment of it.

Prabhat learnt something through the 
observations every day, soon realising the 
change in himself. He had even begun playing 
hide and seek, and felt sad whenever it was 
about to end. He also started joking while 
playing badminton. Soon, the other students 
started talking amongst themselves, “Good fun 
playing	with	Prabhat,	that	fellow	definitely has 
a great sporting spirit.”

We can start practicing yoga at any given moment of time. We 
must remember that when we practice yoga asanas (postures), 
we do not just stretch the body. The mind has to be with the body. 
This is the reason why it should be practised without distractions. 
If each stretch is coordinated with the breath and awareness, 
our practice will become a yogic practice.

Yoga–a WaY of Life
Namaste everyone!
I wish to share with you all that I do simple yoga exercises 
with my grandfather. He has been practising yoga since he 
was	16	years	old.	My	grandfather	is	fit	and	strong	even	at	
the age of 65. I am sure that this is the result of many good 
habits. I know that eating a balanced diet regularly and 
making yoga a part of his life have been hundred per cent 
effective.	When	I	accompany	my	grandfather	to	the	park,	I	
see so many people–young and old–doing yogic breathing 
exercises.

I like doing these exercises. Whenever I’m a little worried 
about an Inter-House competition, I always remember to do 
some of these exercises early morning that day. It relaxes 
me and makes me feel focused and calm. I plan on learning 
some asanas from my grandfather during the summer 
vacations.
Wish me luck!

Up in the air 

See the kites fly, 
Like coloured birds 

In the wind-whipped sky.

I wish I were small
And light as air,

I would climb on a kite
And sail up there.

Then I would drift upon
The paper wings,

And hear the songs
That the wild wind sings.

What fun it would be
To look right down,

Over the park
And the rooftops of town.

The people below
Would stand and stare, 
And wish they were me 

High, high in the air.

 Let us read
 1. When you enter a tiny room in Moti Vavdi 

village, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, you will see 
lots of bright colours. There are many 
lovely things like cushions, bedcovers, 
pillows, and more, with beautiful designs. 
Ila Sachani, a wonderful lady with a big 
smile, makes all these using a shiny needle 
to create these designs. She is very good at Ila Sachani

Kathiawar embroidery—a style that needs 
a lot of skill.

 2. Ila Sachani’s journey began in the quiet 
settings of Amreli, Gujarat, where she 
was born into a farmer’s family. From the 
beginning, life presented its challenges, challenges: 
as Ila was born with her hands hanging difficulties
loose by her sides. Unlike other children, 
she could not use her hands in the usual 
way. While other small hands drew figures 
in the sand or plucked wild flowers, she 
wondered why she could not join them. 
She too wanted to hold a chalk in her hands 
and draw figures on a slate.

 3. Ila’s mother and grandmother 
encouraged the little girl and 
were single-minded to help her 
overcome her challenge. They 
were skilled in the traditional art 
of Kathiawar embroidery and 
decided to share this art with Ila. single-minded:
They taught her to create many focused

beautiful patterns using her feet! It was 
certainly not an easy task, but Ila accepted 
the challenge with determination. Her determination:
parents also helped her learn to do things  will power
with her legs, like eating and combing her 
hair. 

 4. Threading a needle was hard, but Ila did 
not give up and became an expert at a 
young age. Her younger brother and sister 
helped her too. She learned many styles, 
even ones from outside Gujarat—Kachhi, 
Kashmiri, Lucknawi and others.

 5. For Ila, embroidery became a way to express 
herself. At first, she crafted fine designs 
only for her family and friends, who were awestruck: 
awestruck by her talent. They talked about amazed
those designs to others. Soon, the people in 
the village, too, discovered Ila’s special skill 
and the admiration for her work began to 
spread.

 6. Word reached the government office, in 
Surat. They were moved by Ila’s story and 
impressed by her work. They decided to 
display some samples of her embroidery 
at a state exhibition. This experience 
opened new doors for Ila. People observed 
the beauty woven by her feet and readily 
purchased the creations. Ila was no more a 
hidden talent, but famous!

 7. Encouraged by this popularity, Ila popularity: 
participated in more exhibitions, not just fame
within the state but at the national level. 
She received many awards and honours, 
not just for her art but also the willpower 
and creativity that her work showed. Ila 
Sachani, once a farmer’s daughter facing a 
tough challenge, worked hard and became 
a celebrated artist and receiver of the 
President’s Medal.

 8. The most important change for Ila was 
the new independence. Through her skill, 
she not only earned a regular income but 
also found joy in doing what she loved. 
She proved, through her creations, that 
challenges can be turned into victories 
with focus, hard work, positivity and never 
giving up.

 9. Her embroidery, created with her feet, 
reminds us that art has the power to rise 
above physical boundaries and touch 
the soul.

Namaste! You must be tired and hungry after listening to so 
many people. I am Sushil from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. 
Let me tell you a unique dish of my district. It is called gakkad 
bharta. First, we make gakkad from wheat dough. Then, we 
make balls with that dough and roast them on high heat. 
To make bharta, we roast brinjals and tomatoes. Then we 
garnish the bharta with chopped onions, coriander, green 
chillis and salt. This food item is made without frying. To eat 
it, you simply crumble the gakkad and drizzle it with some 
bharta and a spoonful of ghee. Come to Jabalpur and try it!

tHe Kites
Hello everyone! I’m happy to share with you some details 
about the Kite Festival. It is a popular festival in India and it 
takes place during Makar Sankranti in the month of January. 
People can even be seen flying kites from their terraces and 
rooftops and taking part in kite flying competitions. 

This festival is celebrated as Uttarayan in Western India. 
The festival gives everyone a chance to look at kites of 
different shapes, sizes and colours. Gujarat is the main centre 
of celebrations but Uttarayan is also celebrated in Rajasthan 
and Telangana. In Karnataka, the Tourism Department has 
also been organising the kite festival once each year. Punjab 
also celebrates this festival of kites during Baisakhi and 
Basant Panchami.

Kite flying is a tradition that is deep-rooted in Indian 
culture and the Kite Festival is one that is eagerly awaited. 
This is also a reason why people across India also fly kites to 
celebrate Independence Day. Happy kite-flying to all of you!

ila sacHani: 
emBroidering dreams witH Her Feet

Hello everyone! I’m here today to share some simple 
information about Kathiawar embroidery. This is a very old 
form of embroidery. It uses many bright colours and also uses 
many types of stitches, like the chain stitch. The embroidery 
is commonly seen on clothes and home decoration items. 
On clothes, it is seen on children’s caps, ghagra skirts and 
men’s traditional shirts. In this embroidery, a lot of mirror 
work is done by fitting small mirrors along with the stitches. 
Most commonly, the designs used are geometric shapes like 
squares and triangles. The design of flowers is also used. 
There is much more to share but I’ll do that some other time. 
Thank you!
