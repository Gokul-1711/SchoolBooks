1 PATTERNS IN
 MATHEMATICS

1.1 What is Mathematics?
Mathematics is, in large part, the search for patterns, and for 
the explanations as to why those patterns exist.

Such patterns indeed exist all around us — in nature, in 
our homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon, 
and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from 
shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to 
understanding weather patterns and using technology.

The search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun 
and creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians 
think of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, we 
hope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry 
involved in discovering and understanding mathematical 
patterns.

It is important to keep in mind that mathematics 
aims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the 
explanations for why they exist. Such explanations can 
often then be used in applications well beyond the context in 
which they were discovered, which can then help to propel 
humanity forward.

For example, the understanding of patterns in the motion of stars, 
planets, and their satellites led humankind to develop the theory of 
gravitation, allowing us to launch our own satellites and send rockets 
to the Moon and to Mars; similarly, understanding patterns in genomes 
has helped in diagnosing and curing diseases — among thousands of 
other such examples.

2. How has mathematics helped propel humanity forward? (You 
might think of examples involving: carrying out scientific 
experiments; running our economy and democracy; building 
bridges, houses or other complex structures; making TVs, 
mobile phones, computers, bicycles, trains, cars, planes, 
calendars, clocks, etc.)

1.2 Patterns in Numbers
Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are 
patterns of numbers, particularly patterns of whole numbers:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 
The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in whole 

numbers is called number theory.
Number sequences are the most basic and among the most 

fascinating types of patterns that mathematicians study. 
Table 1 shows some key number sequences that are studied in 

Mathematics.

for forming the numbers in the sequence.

1.3  Visualising Number Sequences
Many number sequences can be visualised using pictures. Visualising 
mathematical objects through pictures or diagrams can be a very 
fruitful way to understand mathematical patterns and concepts. 

Let us represent the first seven sequences in Table 1 using the 
following pictures.

2. Why are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, … called triangular numbers? Why 
are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, … called square numbers or squares? 
Why are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, … called cubes?

3. You will have noticed that 36 is both a triangular number and a 
square number! That is, 36 dots can be arranged perfectly both 
in a triangle and in a square. Make pictures in your notebook 
illustrating this! 

 This shows that the same number can be represented differently, 
and play different roles, depending on the context. Try 
representing some other numbers pictorially in different ways! 

4. What would you call the following sequence of numbers?

 That’s right, they are called hexagonal numbers! Draw these in 
your notebook. What is the next number in the sequence?

5. Can you think of pictorial ways to visualise the sequence of 
Powers of 2? Powers of 3?

1.4 Relations among Number Sequences
 Sometimes, number sequences can be related to each other in 
surprising ways.
Example: What happens when we start adding up odd numbers?
    1 = 1
    1 + 3 = 4
    1 + 3 + 5 = 9
    1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
    1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
    1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36 
      ...

This is a really beautiful pattern! 
 Why does this happen? Do you think it will happen forever?
The answer is that the pattern does happen forever. But why? 

As mentioned earlier, the reason why the pattern happens is just as 
important and exciting as the pattern itself.

A picture can explain it
Visualising with a picture can help explain the phenomenon. Recall 
that square numbers are made by counting the number of dots in a 
square grid.

 How can we partition the dots in a square grid into odd Math 
numbers of dots: 1, 3, 5, 7,... ? Talk

Think about it for a moment before reading further!

Patterns in Mathematics

Here is how it can be done:

This picture now makes it evident that 

1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36.

Because such a picture can be made for a square of any size, this 
explains why adding up odd numbers gives square numbers.

 By drawing a similar picture, can you say what is the sum of the 
first 10 odd numbers? 

 Now by imagining a similar picture, or by drawing it partially, as 
needed, can you say what is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers?

Another example of such a relation between sequences: 
Adding up and down
Let us look at the following pattern:
   1 = 1
   1 + 2 + 1 = 4
   1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 25
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36 

...

This seems to be giving yet another way of getting the square numbers—
by adding the counting numbers up and then down!

1. Can you find a similar pictorial explanation for why adding Try

counting numbers up and down, i.e., 1, 1 + 2 + 1, 1 + 2 + 3 + This

2. By imagining a large version of your picture, or drawing 
it partially, as needed, can you see what will be the value of 
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 99 + 100 + 99 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1?

3. Which sequence do you get when you start to add the All 1’s 
sequence up? What sequence do you get when you add the All 1’s 
sequence up and down?

4. Which sequence do you get when you start to add the counting 
numbers up? Can you give a smaller pictorial explanation?

5. What happens when you add up pairs of consecutive triangular 
numbers? That is, take 1 + 3, 3 + 6, 6 + 10, 10 + 15, … Which sequence 
do you get? Why? Can you explain it with a picture?

6. What happens when you start to add up powers of 2 starting with 
1, i.e., take 1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 4, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8, … ? Now add 1 to each 
of these numbers — what numbers do you get? Why does this 
happen?

7. What happens when you multiply the triangular numbers by 6 
and add 1? Which sequence do you get? Can you explain it with a 
picture?

8. What happens when you start to add up hexagonal numbers, i.e., 
take 1, 1 + 7, 1 + 7 + 19, 1 + 7 + 19 + 37, … ? Which sequence do you 
get? Can you explain it using a picture of a cube?

      

9.  Find your own patterns or relations in and among the sequences 
in Table 1. Can you explain why they happen with a picture or 
otherwise?

1.5  Patterns in Shapes
Other important and basic patterns that occur in Mathematics 
are patterns of shapes. These shapes may be in one, two, or three 
dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D) — or in even more dimensions.  The 
branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in shapes is called 
geometry.

Shape sequences are one important type of shape pattern that 
mathematicians study. Table 3 shows a few key shape sequences 
that are studied in Mathematics.

Table 3? Math 
2. Try and redraw each sequence in Table 3 in your notebook. Talk

Can you draw the next shape in each sequence? Why or why 
not? After each sequence, describe in your own words what 
is the rule or pattern for forming the shapes in the sequence.

1.6  Relation to Number Sequences
Often, shape sequences are related to number sequences in 
surprising ways. Such relationships can be helpful in studying and 
understanding both the shape sequence and the related number 
sequence.
Example: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular 
Polygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular 
triangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, 
octagon, nonagon, decagon, etc., respectively. 

The word ‘regular’ refers to the fact that these shapes have 
equal-length sides and also equal ‘angles’ (i.e., the sides look the same 
and the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more 
depth in the next chapter. 

The other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful 
relationships with number sequences.

 Figure it Out
1. Count the number of sides in each shape in the sequence Try

of Regular Polygons. Which number sequence do you get? This
What about the number of corners in each shape in the 
sequence of Regular Polygons? Do you get the same number 
sequence? Can you explain why this happens?

2. Count the number of lines in each shape in the sequence 
of Complete Graphs. Which number sequence do you get? 
Can you explain why?

3. How many little squares are there in each shape of the 
sequence of Stacked Squares? Which number sequence 
does this give? Can you explain why?

4. How many little triangles are there in each shape of the 
sequence of Stacked Triangles? Which number sequence 
does this give? Can you explain why? (Hint: In each shape in Try

This
the sequence, how many triangles are there in each row?)

5. To get from one shape to the next shape in the Koch 
Snowflake sequence, one replaces each line segment ‘—’ 
by a ‘speed bump’ . As one does this more and more 
times, the changes become tinier and tinier with very very 
small line segments. How many total line segments are 
there in each shape of the Koch Snowflake? What is the 
corresponding number sequence? (The answer is 3, 12, 48, ..., 
i.e., 3 times Powers of 4; this sequence is not shown in Table 1.)

Summary
 Mathematics may be viewed as the search for patterns and for the 

explanations as to why those patterns exist.
 Among the most basic patterns that occur in mathematics are number 

sequences.
 Some important examples of number sequences include the counting 

numbers, odd numbers, even numbers, square numbers, triangular 
numbers, cube numbers, Virahānka numbers, and powers of 2.

 Sometimes number sequences can be related to each other in beautiful 
and remarkable ways. For example, adding up the sequence of odd 
numbers starting with 1 gives square numbers. 

 Visualising number sequences using pictures can help to understand 
sequences and the relationships between them.

 Shape sequences are another basic type of pattern in mathematics. 
Some important examples of shape sequences include regular polygons, 
complete graphs, stacked triangles and squares, and Koch snowflake 
iterations. Shape sequences also exhibit many interesting relationships 
with number sequences.

2 Lines and angLes

 In this chapter, we will explore some of the most basic ideas of 
geometry including points, lines, rays, line segments and angles. 
These ideas form the building blocks of ‘plane geometry’, and will 
help us in understanding more advanced topics in geometry such as 
the construction and analysis of different shapes.

 2.1 Point
Mark a dot on the paper with a sharp tip of a pencil. The sharper the 
tip, the thinner will be the dot. This tiny dot will give you an idea of 
a point. A point determines a precise location, but it has no length, 
breadth or height. Some models for a point are given below. 

The tip of a The sharpened The pointed 
compass end of a pencil end of a needle 

If you mark three points on a piece of paper, 
you may be required to distinguish these three Z P
points. For this purpose, each of the three points 
may be denoted by a single capital letter such as T

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   13 13-08-2024   16:14:25



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Z, P and T. These points are read as ‘Point Z’, ‘Point P’ and ‘Point T’. Of 
course, the dots represent precise locations and must be imagined to be 
invisibly thin.

 2.2 Line Segment
A

Fold a piece of paper and unfold it. Do you 
see a crease? This gives the idea of a line 
segment. It has two end points, A and B.

Mark any two points A and B on a sheet of 
paper. Try to connect A to B by various B
routes  (Fig. 2.1).

What is the shortest route from A to B? B
This shortest path from Point A to Point B 
(including A and B) as shown here is called 
the line segment from A to B. It is denoted by 

A
either AB or BA. The points A and B are called 
the end points of the line segment AB. Fig. 2.1

 2.3 Line
m

Imagine that the line segment from A to B (i.e., 
AB) is extended beyond A in one direction and B

beyond B in the other direction without any 
end (see Fig. 2.2). This is a model for a line. Do A
you think you can draw a complete picture of Fig. 2.2
a line? No. Why?

A line through two points A and B is written as AB. It extends 
forever in both directions. Sometimes a line is denoted by a letter like 
l or m.

Observe that any two points determine a unique line that passes 
through both of them.

Lines and Angles

2.4 Ray
A ray is a portion of a line that starts at one point (called the starting 
point or initial point of the ray) and goes on endlessly in a direction. 
The following are some models for a ray:

Beam of light from a Ray of light from a torch Sun rays
lighthouse   

Look at the diagram (Fig. 2.3) of a ray. Two points are 
marked on it. One is the starting point A and the other P
is a point P on the path of the ray. We then denote the 
ray by AP.

2.5 Angle D

An angle is formed by two rays having a arm

common starting point. Here is an angle 
formed by rays BD  and BE  where B is B

vertex
the common starting point (Fig. 2.8). arm

The point B is called the vertex of the 
E

angle, and the rays BD  and BE  are called Fig. 2.8
the arms of the angle. How can we name 
this angle? We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle B. 
To be clearer, we use a point on each of the arms together with the 
vertex to name the angle. In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE 
or Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠’, i.e., 
∠DBE or ∠EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always 
written as the middle letter.

To indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer 
to Fig. 2.9).

Vidya has just opened her book. Let us observe her opening the 
cover of the book in different scenarios.

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   17 13-08-2024   16:14:27



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

 Do you see angles being made in each of these cases? Can you mark 
their arms and vertex?

Which angle is greater—the angle in Case 1 or the angle in Case 2? 
Just as we talk about the size of a line based on its length, we also 

talk about the size of an angle based on its amount of rotation. 
So, the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate 

the cover more. Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that 
of Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6 
are successively larger angles with more and more rotation.

The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed 
about the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray. 

Final position of ray

Amount of turn is the size of 
the angle

Vertex Initial position of ray
Fig. 2.9

Let’s look at some other examples where angles arise in real life 
by rotation or turn: 

• In a compass or divider, we turn the arms to form 
an angle. The vertex is the point where the two 
arms are joined. Identify the arms and vertex of 
the angle.  

• A pair of scissors has two blades. When we open 
them (or ‘turn them’) to cut something, the blades 
form an angle. Identify the arms and the vertex of 
the angle.

• Look at the pictures of spectacles, wallet and other common 
objects. Identify the angles in them by marking out their arms 
and vertices.

Do you see how these angles are formed by turning one arm with 
respect to the other?

2.6 Comparing Angles
Look at these animals opening their mouths. Do you see any angles 
here? If yes, mark the arms and vertex of each one. Some mouths are 
open wider than others; the more the turning of the jaws, the larger 
the angle! Can you arrange the angles in this picture from smallest to 
largest?

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Comparing angles by superimposition
Any two angles can be compared by placing them one over the other, 
i.e., by superimposition. While superimposing, the vertices of the 
angles must overlap.

After superimposition, it becomes clear which angle is smaller 
and which is larger. 

P P
A A

B C Q R Q (B) R C

The picture shows the two angles superimposed. It is now clear 
that ∠PQR is larger than ∠ABC.
Equal angles. Now consider ∠AOB and ∠XOY in the figure. Which 
is greater? 

X X
A A

O B O Y O B Y

The corners of both of these angles match and the arms overlap with 
each other, i.e., OA ↔ OX and OB ↔ OY. So, the angles are equal in size.

The reason these angles are considered to be equal in size is 
because when we visualise each of these angles as being formed out 
of rotation, we can see that there is an equal amount of rotation 
needed to move  OB to OA  and OY  to OX.

From the point of view of superimposition, when two angles 
are superimposed, and the common vertex and the two rays of 
both angles lie on top of each other, then the sizes of the angles 
are equal.

before, one could trace these angles, superimpose them and then 
check. But can we do it without superimposition?

Suppose we have a transparent circle which can be moved and 
placed on figures. Can we use this for comparison? 

Let us place the circular paper on the angle made by the first 
crane. The circle is placed in such a way that its centre is on the 
vertex of the angle. Let us mark the points A and B on the edge circle 
at the points where the arms of the angle pass through the circle.

Can we use this to find out if this angle is greater than, or equal to 
or smaller than the angle made by the second crane? 

Let us place it on the angle made by the second crane so that the 
vertex coincides with the centre of the circle and one of the arms 
passes through OA.

Which crane was making the bigger angle?
If you can make a circular piece of transparent paper, try this method 
to compare the angles in Fig. 2.10 with each other.

     Teacher’s Note
A teacher needs to check the understanding of the students around 
the notion of an angle. Sometimes students might think that 
increasing the length of the arms of the angle increases the angle. 
For this, various situations should be posed to the students to check 
their understanding on the same. 

2.7 Making Rotating Arms
Let us make ‘rotating arms’ using two paper straws and a paper clip 
by following these steps:

1. Take two paper straws and a paper clip.  

2. Insert the straws into the arms of the paper 
clip. 

3. Your rotating arm is ready!

Make several ‘rotating arms’ with different angles between the 
arms. Arrange the angles you have made from smallest to largest by 
comparing and using superimposition.
Passing through a slit: Collect a number of rotating arms with different 
angles; do not rotate any of the rotating arms during this activity.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Take a cardboard and make an angle-shaped slit as shown below 
by tracing and cutting out the shape of one of the rotating arms.

Now, shuffle and mix up all the rotating arms. Can you identify 
which of the rotating arms will pass through the slit? 

The correct one can be found by placing each of the rotating arms 
over the slit. Let us do this for some of the rotating arms:

Slit angle is greater than Slit angle is less than the Slit angle is equal to the 
the arms’ angle. The arms arms’ angle. The arms arms’ angle. The arms will

slit. slit.

Only the pair of rotating arms where the angle is equal to that of the 
slit passes through the slit. Note that the possibility of passing through 
the slit depends only on the angle between the rotating arms and not 
on their lengths (as long as they are shorter than the length of the slit).

2.8 Special Types of Angles
Let us go back to Vidya’s 
notebook and observe her 
opening the cover of the book 
in different scenarios. 

She makes a full turn of the 
cover when she has to write 
while holding the book in 
her hand. 

She makes a half turn of the 
cover when she has to open 
it on her table. In this case, 
observe the arms of the angle formed. They lie in a straight line. 
Such an angle is called a straight angle. 

A O B

Let us consider a straight angle ∠AOB. Observe that any ray OC  
divides it into two angles, ∠AOC and ∠COB.

 Is it possible to draw OC  such that the two angles are Math 
equal to each other in size? Talk

Let’s Explore
We can try to solve this problem using a piece of paper. Recall that when 
a fold is made, it creates a crease which is straight.

Take a rectangular piece of paper and on one of its sides, mark 
the straight angle AOB. By folding, try to get a line (crease) passing 
through O that divides ∠AOB into two equal angles.

How can it be done? 

Fold the paper such that OB overlaps with OA. Observe the crease 
and the two angles formed.

Lines and Angles

Justify why the two angles are equal. Is there a way to 
superimpose and check? Can this superimposition be done by 
folding? 

Each of these equal angles formed are called right angles. So, a 
straight angle contains two right angles.

angle?

 If a straight angle is formed by half of a full turn, how much of a 
full turn will form a right angle?  

Observe that a right angle resembles the shape of an ‘L’. An angle 
is a right angle only if it is exactly half of a straight angle. Two lines 
that meet at right angles are called perpendicular lines.

1. How many right angles do the windows of your classroom 

contain? Do you see other right angles in your classroom?

b.  Describe how you folded the paper so that any other person

Classifying Angles
Angles are classified in three groups as shown below. Right angles 
are shown in the second group. What could be the common feature 
of the other two groups?

In the first group, all angles are less than a right angle or in other 
words, less than a quarter turn. Such angles are called acute angles.

In the third group, all angles are greater than a right angle but 
less than a straight angle. The turning is more than a quarter turn 
and less than a half turn. Such angles are called obtuse angles.

 Figure it Out
1. Identify acute, right, obtuse and straight angles in the previous 

figures.
2. Make a few acute angles and a few obtuse angles. Draw them in 

different orientations.

sharp and obtuse means blunt. Why do you think these words have 
been chosen?

4.  Find out the number of acute angles in each of the figures below.

What will be the next figure and how many acute angles will it have? 
Do you notice any pattern in the numbers?

2.9 Measuring Angles
We have seen how to compare two angles. But can we actually 
quantify how big an angle is using a number without having to 
compare it to another angle?

We saw how various angles can be compared using a circle. 
Perhaps a circle could be used to assign measures for angles?

Fig. 2.12

To assign precise measures to angles, mathematicians came up 
with an idea. They divided the angle in the centre of the circle into 

32

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   32 13-08-2024   16:14:34



Lines and Angles

360 equal angles or parts. The angle measure of each of these unit 
parts is 1 degree, which is written as 1°.

This unit part is used to assign measure to any angle: the measure 
of an angle is the number of 1° unit parts it contains inside it. 
For example, see this figure:

30 units

It contains 30 units of 1° angle and so we say that its angle measure is 30°.
Measures of different angles: What is the measure of a full turn in 
degrees? As we have taken it to contain 360 degrees, its measure is 360°.

 What is the measure of a straight angle in degrees? A straight 
angle is half of a full turn. As a full-turn is 360°, a half turn is 180°.
What is the measure of a right angle in degrees? Two right angles 
together form a straight angle. As a straight angle measures 180°, a 
right angle measures 90°.

A pinch of history

we use 360° today is not fully known. The division of a circle into

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   33 14-08-2024   14:20:43



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

360 parts goes back to ancient times. The Rigveda, one of the very 
oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of 
a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars, 
also going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia, 
Babylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In 
addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60 
and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s. 

Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why 
mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360 
degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided 
by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the 
circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole 
number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible 
by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of 
hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful. 

 The circle has been divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 10 and 12 parts 
below. What are the degree measures of the resulting angles? Write 
the degree measures down near the indicated angles.

Degree measures of different angles
How can we measure other angles in degrees? It is for this purpose 
that we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided 
into 360 equal parts as shown in Fig. 2.12 (on page 32), or a half 
circle divided into 180 equal parts.

Unlabelled protractor
Here is a protractor. Do you see the straight angle at the center 
divided into 180 units of 1 
degree? Only part of the 
lines dividing the straight 
angle are visible, though!  

Starting from the 
marking on the rightmost 
point of the base, there 
is a long mark for every 
10°. From every such long 
mark, there is a medium 
sized mark after 5°.

 Figure it out
1. Write the measures of the 
following angles:

K
a.	∠ KAL 

Notice that the vertex of this 
angle coincides with the centre of 

L the protractor.  So the number of 
units of 1 degree angle between KA 

A and AL gives the measure of ∠KAL. 
By counting, we get —
  ∠KAL = 30°

Making use of the medium sized 
and large sized marks, is it possible 
to count the number of units in 5s 
or 10s?

made on a protractor. We will now see how we can make some of them!
1.  Draw a circle of a convenient radius on a sheet of paper. Cut out 

the circle (Fig. 2.13). A circle or one full turn is 360°.
2.  Fold the circle to get two equal halves and cut it through the 

crease to get a semicircle. Write ‘0°’ in the bottom right corner of 
the semicircle.

Angle Bisector
At each step, we folded in halves. This process of getting half of a 
given angle is called bisecting the angle. The line that bisects a given 
angle is called the angle bisector of the angle.
Identify the angle bisectors in your handmade protractor. Try to make 
different angles using the concept of angle bisector through paper folding.

be the arms of the angle?

3. Vidya is enjoying her time 
on the swing. She notices 
that the greater the angle 
with which she starts the 
swinging, the greater is 
the speed she achieves on 
her swing. But where is the 
angle? Are you able to see 
any angle?

4. Here is a toy with slanting slabs attached to 
its sides; the greater the angles or slopes of 
the slabs, the faster the balls roll. Can angles 
be used to describe the slopes of the slabs? 
What are the arms of each angle? Which 
arm is visible and which is not?

5. Observe the images below where there is 
an insect and its rotated version. Can angles 
be used to describe the amount of rotation? 
How? What will be the arms of the angle and 
the vertex?

 Hint: Observe the horizontal line touching the insects.

Teacher’s Note 
It is important that students see the application of each mathematical 
concept in their daily lives. Teacher can organise some activities where 
students can appreciate the practical applications of angles in real-life 
situations, e.g., clocks, doors, swings, concepts of uphill and downhill, 
location of the sun, the giving of directions, etc.

2.10 Drawing Angles
Vidya wants to draw a 30° angle and name it ∠TIN using a protractor.

In   will be the vertex, IT and IN will be the arms of the angle.
Keeping one arm, say IN, as the reference (base), the other arm IT should 
take a turn of 30°.

 Let’s Play a Game #1
This is an angle guessing game! Play this game with your classmates 
by making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2. Here are the instructions 
and rules for the game:

• Team 1 secretly choose an angle measure, for example, 49° and 
makes an angle with that measure using a protractor without 
Team 2 being able to see it. 

• Team 2 now gets to look at the angle. They have to quickly 
discuss and guess the number of degrees in the angle (without 
using a protractor!).

• Team 1 now demonstrates the true measure of the angle with 
a protractor. 

• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute 
difference in degrees between their guess and the correct 
measure. For example, if Team 2 guesses 39°, then they score 
10 points (49°–39°).

• Each team gets five turns. The winner is the team with the 
lowest score!

 Let’s Play a Game #2
We now change the rules of the game a bit. Play this game with your 
classmates by again making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2. Here 
are the instructions and rules:

48

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd   48 13-08-2024   16:14:40



Lines and Angles

• Team 1 announces to all, an angle measure, e.g., 34°. 
• A player from Team 2 must draw that angle on the board without 

using a protractor. Other members of Team 2 can help the player 
by speaking words like ‘Make it bigger!’ or ‘Make it smaller!’.

• A player from Team 1 measures the angle with a protractor 
for all to see. 

• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute 
difference in degrees between Team 2’s angle size and the 
intended angle size. For example, if player’s angle from Team  2 
is measured to be 25°, then Team 2 scores 9 points (34°–25°).

• Each team gets five turns. The winner is again the team with the 
lowest score.

Teacher’s Note
These games are important to play to build intuition about angles 
and their measures. Return to this game at least once or twice on 
different days to build practice in estimating angles. Note that 
these games can also be played between pairs of students.

 Figure it Out 

1. In Fig. 2.23, list all the angles possible. Did you find them all? Now, 
guess the measures of all the angles. Then, measure the angles 
with a protractor. Record all your numbers in a table. See how 
close your guesses are to the actual measures.

2.11 Types of Angles and their Measures
We have read about different types of angles in this chapter. We 
have seen that a straight angle is 180° and a right angle is 90°. How 
can other types of angles — acute and obtuse — be described in terms 
of their degree measures?
Acute Angle: Angles that are smaller than the right angle, i.e., less 
than 90° and are greater than 0°, are called acute angles.

6. The Ashoka Chakra has 24 spokes. What is the 
degree measure of the angle between two spokes 
next to each other? What is the largest acute angle 
formed between two spokes?

7. Puzzle: I am an acute angle. If you double my 
measure, you get an acute angle. If you triple my measure, you 
will get an acute angle again. If you quadruple (four times) my 
measure, you will get an acute angle yet again! But if you multiply 
my measure by 5, you will get an obtuse angle measure. What are 
the possibilities for my measure?

Summary
 A point determines a location. It is denoted by a capital letter.
 A line segment corresponds to the shortest distance between two 

points. The line segment joining points S and T is denoted by ST.  
 A line is obtained when a line segment like ST is extended on both 

sides indefinitely; it is denoted by ST or sometimes by a single small 
letter like m.

 A ray is a portion of a line starting at a point D and going in one direction 
indefinitely. It is denoted by DP	where P is another point on the ray.

 An angle can be visualised as two rays starting from a common starting 
point. Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM (also called ∠MOP); 
here, O is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays OP and OM are 
called the arms of the angle.

 The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the 
vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle. 

 The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees. One full rotation or 
turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360°.

 Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor.
 Angles can be straight (180°), right (90°), acute (more than 0° and less 

than 90°), obtuse (more than 90° and less than 180°), and reflex (more 
than 180° and less than 360°).

3 NUMBER PLAY

Numbers are used in different contexts and in many different ways 
to organise our lives. We have used numbers to count, and have 
applied the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication 
and division on them, to solve problems related to our daily lives. 

In this chapter, we will continue this journey, by playing with 
numbers, seeing numbers around us, noticing patterns, and learning 
to use numbers and operations in new ways.

 Think about various situations where we use numbers. Math 
List five different situations in which numbers are used. See what Talk
your classmates have listed, share, and discuss.

3.1 Numbers can Tell us Things
What are these numbers telling us?
Some children in a park are standing in a line. Each one says a number.

 What do you think these numbers mean?
 The children now rearrange themselves, and again each one 
says a number based on the arrangement.

Chapter 3_Number Play.indd   55 14-08-2024   14:43:33



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Did you figure out what these numbers represent?
Hint:  Could their heights be playing a role?
A child says ‘1’ if there is only one taller child standing next to them. 
A child says ‘2’ if both the children standing next to them are taller. 
A child says ‘0’, if neither of the children standing next to them are taller. 
That is each person says the number of taller neighbours they have.

 Try answering the questions below and share your reasoning.
1.  Can the children rearrange themselves so that the children Math 

Talk
standing at the ends say ‘2’?

2.  Can we arrange the children in a line so that all would say 
only 0s?

3.  Can two children standing next to each other say the same 
number? 

4.  There are 5 children in a group, all of different heights. Can 
they stand such that four of them say ‘1’ and the last one says 
‘0’? Why or why not?

5.  For this group of 5 children, is the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 possible? 
6.  Is the sequence 0, 1, 2, 1, 0 possible? Why or why not?
7.  How would you rearrange the five children so that the 

maximum number of children say ‘2’?

3.2 Supercells
Observe the numbers written in the table below. Why are some 
numbers coloured? Discuss.

43 79 75 63 10 29 28 34

200 577 626 345 790 694 109 198

A cell is coloured if the number in it is larger than its adjacent 
cells. The number 626 is coloured as it is larger than 577 and 345, 
whereas 200 is not coloured as it is smaller than 577. The number 
198 is coloured as it has only one adjacent cell with 109 in it, and 198 
is larger than 109.

7. Will the cell having the largest number in a table always be a 

supercell? Can the cell having the smallest number in a table 
be a supercell? Why or why not?

8. Fill a table such that the cell having the second largest number 
is not a supercell.

9. Fill a table such that the cell having the second largest 
number is not a supercell but the second smallest number is 
a supercell. Is it possible?

10. Make other variations of this puzzle and challenge your 
classmates.

Let’s do the supercells activity with more rows.
Here the neighbouring cells are those that are immediately to the 
left, right, top and bottom. Table 1
 The rule remains the same : a 
cell becomes a supercell if the 2430 7500 7350 9870
number in it is greater than all 
the numbers in its neighbouring 3115 4795 9124 9230
cells. In Table 1, 8632 is greater 4580 8632 8280 3446
than all its neighbours 4580, 
8280, 4795 and 1944.  5785 1944 5805 6034

3.6 The Magic Number of Kaprekar
D.R. Kaprekar was a mathematics teacher in a 
government school in Devlali, Maharashtra. He liked 
playing with numbers very much and found many 
beautiful patterns in numbers that were previously 
unknown.

In 1949, he discovered a fascinating and magical 
phenomenon when playing with 4-digit numbers. 

*The answer is yes! For 3-digit numbers the answer is unknown.  It is suspected that 
starting with 196 never yields a palindrome!

Follow these steps and experience the magic for yourselves! Pick 
any 4-digit number having at least two different digits, say 6382.

Take a 4-digit number.

Make the largest number from these 
digits. Call it A. 

Make the smallest number from these Use digits 
digits. Call it B. of C

Subtract B from A. Call it C.
C = A – B

What happens if we continue 
doing this?

A = 8632   A = 6642   A = 7641   A = 
B = 2368   B = 2466   B = 1467   B =
C = 8632–2368  C = 6642–2466  C = 7641–1467  C = 
   = 6264      = 4176      = 6174

 Explore
Take different 4-digit numbers and try carrying out these steps. Find 
out what happens. Check with your friends what they got. 

You will always reach the magic number ‘6174’! The number 
‘6174’ is now called the ‘Kaprekar constant’.

Carry out these same steps with a few 3-digit numbers. What 
number will start repeating?

the middle can be used as many times as needed to get the desired 
sum. Draw arrows from the middle to the numbers on the sides to 
obtain the desired sums. 
Two examples are given. It is simpler to do it mentally!
38,800 = 25,000   +     400  ×  2   +   13,000
   3400 =    1500   +   1500           +        400

 Can we make 1,000 using the numbers in the middle? Why not? Math 
What about 14,000, 15,000 and 16,000? Yes, it is possible. Explore how. Talk
What thousands cannot be made?

Adding and Subtracting 
Here, using the numbers in the boxes, we are allowed to use both addition 
and subtraction to get the required number. An example is shown.

40,000 7,000 39,800 = 40,000 – 800 + 300 + 300
45,000 = 

300 1,500   5,900 =
17,500 = 

12,000 800 21,400 =

Digits and Operations 
An example of adding two 5-digit numbers to get another 5-digit 
number is 12,350 + 24,545 = 36,895. 

An example of subtracting two 5-digit numbers to get another 
5-digit number is 48,952 – 24,547 = 24,405.

3.10 An Unsolved Mystery — the Collatz Conjecture!
Look at the sequences below—the same rule is applied in all the 
sequences:

a. 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
b. 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
c. 21, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
d. 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Do you see how these sequences were formed? 

68

Chapter 3_Number Play.indd   68 14-08-2024   14:43:46

125



Number Play

The rule is: one starts with any number; if the number is even, 
take half of it; if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1; 
repeat.

Notice that all four sequences above eventually reached the 
number 1. In 1937, the German mathematician, Lothar Collatz 
conjectured that the sequence will always reach 1, regardless of 
the whole number you start with. Even today — despite many 
mathematicians working on it — it remains an unsolved problem as 
to whether Collatz’s conjecture is true! Collatz’s conjecture is one of 
the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.

 Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting 
with your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1?  

Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences 
will eventually reach 1?  Why or why not?

3.11 Simple Estimation
At times, we may not know or need an exact count of things and 
an estimate is sufficient for the purpose at hand. For example, 
your school headmaster might know the exact number of students 
enrolled in your school, but you may only know an estimated 
count. How many students are in your school? About 150? 400? A 
thousand?

Paromita’s class section has 32 children. The other 2 sections of 
her class have 29 and 35 children. So, she estimated the number of 
children in her class to be about 100. Along with Class 6, her school 
also has Classes 7–10 and each class has 3 sections each. She assumed 
a similar number in each class and estimated the number of students 
in her school to be around 500.

 Figure it Out
  We shall do some simple estimates. It is a fun exercise, and you may 

find it amusing to know the various numbers around us. Remember, 

69

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

we are not interested in the exact numbers for the following questions. 
Share your methods of estimation with the class.
1.  Steps you would take to walk:

a. From the place you are sitting to the classroom door
b. Across the school ground from start to end 
c. From your classroom door to the school gate
d. From your school to your home 

2. Number of times you blink your eyes or number of breaths you 
take:
a. In a minute 
b. In an hour
c. In a day

3. Name some objects around you that are:
a. a few thousand in number
b. more than ten thousand in number

 Estimate the answer
 Try to guess within 30 seconds. Check your guess with your friends.

1.  Number of words in your maths textbook:
a. More than 5000   
b. Less than 5000

2.  Number of students in your school who travel to school by bus: 
a. More than 200    
b. Less than 200

3.  Roshan wants to buy milk and 3 types of fruit to make fruit 
custard for 5 people. He estimates the cost to be ₹100. Do you

6.  Earlier, people used to walk long distances as they had no other 
means of transport. Suppose you walk at your normal pace. 
Approximately, how long would it take you to go from: 

a. Your current location to one of your favourite places nearby. 
b. Your current location to any neighbouring state’s capital city. 
c. The southernmost point in India to the northernmost point in 

India.
7. Make some estimation questions and challenge your classmates! 

3.12 Games and Winning Strategies
Numbers can also be used to play games and develop winning 
strategies.

Here is a famous game called 21. Play it with a classmate. Then 
try it at home with your family!

 Rules for Game #1: The first player says 1, 2 or 3. Then the two 
players take turns adding 1, 2, or 3 to the previous number said. The 
first player to reach 21 wins!

Play this game several times with your classmate.  Are you starting 
to see the winning strategy? 

Which player can always win if they play correctly? What is the 
pattern of numbers that the winning player should say?

There are many variations of this game. Here is another common 
variation:

 Rules for Game #2: The first player says a number between 1 and 
10. Then the two players take turns adding a number between 1 and 
10 to the previous number said. The first player to reach 99 wins!

Play this game several times with your classmate. See if you can 
figure out the corresponding winning strategy in this case! Which 

71

Chapter 3_Number Play.indd   71 14-08-2024   14:43:46



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

player can always win? What is the pattern of numbers that the 
winning player should say this time?

Make your own variations of this game — decide how much one 
can add at each turn, and what number is the winning number. Then 
play your game several times, and figure out the winning strategy 
and which player can always win!

 Figure it Out 
1. There is only one supercell

exchange two digits of one of 
the numbers, there will be 4 19,381 50,319 38,408
supercells. Figure out which 
digits to swap.

2. How many rounds does your year of birth take to reach the 
Kaprekar constant?

3. We are the group of 5-digit numbers between 35,000 and 75,000 
such that all of our digits are odd. Who is the largest number in our 
group? Who is the smallest number in our group? Who among us 
is the closest to 50,000? 

4. Estimate the number of holidays you get in a year including 
weekends, festivals and vacation. Then, try to get an exact number 
and see how close your estimate is. 

5. Estimate the number of liters a mug, a bucket and an overhead 
tank can hold. 

6. Write one 5-digit number and two 3-digit numbers such that their 
sum is 18,670. 

7. Choose a number between 210 and 390. Create a number pattern 
similar to those shown in Section 3.9 that will sum up to this number.

  8. Recall the sequence of Powers of 2 from Chapter 1, Table 1. Why is 
the Collatz conjecture correct for all the starting numbers in this 
sequence?

  9. Check if the Collatz Conjecture holds for the starting number 100.  
10. Starting with 0, players alternate adding numbers between 1 and 3. 

The first person to reach 22 wins. What is the winning strategy now?

Summary

 Numbers can be used for many different purposes including, to convey 
information, make and discover patterns, estimate magnitudes, pose 
and solve puzzles, and play and win games. 

 Thinking about and formulating set procedures to use numbers for 
these purposes is a useful skill and capacity (called ‘computational 
thinking’).

 Many problems about numbers can be very easy to pose, but very 
difficult to solve.  Indeed, numerous such problems are still unsolved 
(for example, Collatz’s Conjecture).

4 Data HanDling anD 
Presentation

If you ask your classmates about their favourite colours, you will 
get a list of colours. This list is an example of data. Similarly, if you 
measure the weight of each student in your class, you would get a 
collection of measures of weight—again data. 
 Any collection of facts, numbers, measures, observations or other 
descriptions of things that convey information about those things is 
called data.
 We live in an age of information. We constantly see large amounts 
of data presented to us in new and interesting ways. In this chapter, 
we will explore some of the ways that data is presented, and how we 
can use some of those ways to correctly display, interpret and make 
inferences from such data!

4.1 Collecting and Organising Data
Navya and Naresh are discussing their favourite games.

Cricket is my I play cricket sometimes 
favourite game! but hockey is the game I 

like the most. 

I think cricket is the I am not sure. How can we find 
most popular game in the most popular game in our 

our class. class?

Data Handling and Presentation

To figure out the most popular game in 
their class, what should Navya and Naresh 
do? Can you help them?

 Naresh and Navya decided to go to each student in the class and 
ask what their favourite game is. Then they prepared a list.
 Navya is showing the list:

Mehnoor – Kabaddi Pushkal – Satoliya (Pittu) Anaya – Kabaddi 
Jubimon – Hockey Densy – Badminton Jivisha – Satoliya  (Pittu) 
Simran – Kabaddi Jivika – Satoliya  (Pittu) Rajesh – Football 
Nand – Satoliya  (Pittu) Leela – Hockey Thara – Football 
Ankita – Kabaddi Afshan – Hockey Soumya – Cricket 
Imon – Hockey Keerat – Cricket Navjot – Hockey 
Yuvraj – Cricket Gurpreet – Hockey Hemal – Satoliya  (Pittu)
Rehana – Hockey Arsh – Kabaddi Debabrata – Football 
Aarna – Badminton Bhavya – Cricket Ananya – Hockey 
Kompal – Football Sarah – Kabaddi Hardik – Cricket 
Tahira – Cricket

 She says (happily), “I have collected the data. I can figure out the 
most popular game now!”.
 A few other children are looking at the list and wondering, “We 
can’t yet see the most popular game. How can we get it from this list?”.

 Figure it Out
1.  What would you do to find the most popular game among Naresh’s 

and Navya’s classmates?
2. What is the most popular game in their class?
3.  Try to find out the most popular game among your classmates.

 Shri Nilesh is a teacher. He decided to bring sweets to the class 
to celebrate the new year. The sweets shop nearby has jalebi, gulab 
jamun, gujiya, barfi, and rasgulla. He wanted to know the choices of 
the children. He wrote the names of the sweets on the board and 
asked each child to tell him their preference. He put a tally mark 
‘|’ for each student and when the count reached 5, he put a line 
through the previous four and marked it as ||||.

Sweets Tally Marks No. of Students

 Shri Nilesh requested one of the staff members to bring the sweets as 
given in the table. The above table helped him to purchase the correct 
numbers of sweets.
  2.  Is the above table sufficient to distribute each type of sweet to 

the correct student? Explain. If it is not sufficient, what is the 
alternative?

To organise the data, we can write the name of each sweet in one 
column and using tally signs, note the number of students who prefer 
that sweet. The numbers 6, 9, … are the frequencies of the sweet 
preferences for jalebi, gulab jamun … respectively.

 Sushri Sandhya asked her students about the sizes of the shoes 
they wear. She noted the data on the board.

c. W ere there any two trees found in the same numbers? 

 5.  Take a blank piece of paper and paste any small news item from 
a newspaper. Each student may use a different article. Now, 
prepare a table on the piece of paper as given below. Count the 
number of each of the letters ‘c’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘r’, and ‘x’ in the words of 
the news article, and fill in the table. 

Letter c e i r x Any other letter

a. The letter found the most number of times is  ________.
b. The letter found the least number of times is  ________.
c. List the five letters ‘c’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘r’, ‘x’ in ascending order of 

frequency.  Now, compare the order of your list with that of 
your classmates. Is your order the same or nearly the same 
as theirs? (Almost everyone is likely to get the order ‘x, c, r, 
i, e’.) Why do you think this is the case?

Teacher’s Note
Provide more opportunities to collect and organise data. Ask students 
to guess what is the most popular colour, game, toy, school subject, etc., 
amongst the students in their classroom and then collect the data for it. 
It can be a fun activity in which they also learn about their classmates. 
Discuss how they can organise the data in different ways, each way 
having its own advantages and limitations. For all these tasks and the 
tasks under ‘Figure it Out’, discuss the tasks with the children and let 
them understand the tasks, and then let them plan and present their 
research processes and conclusions in the class.

4.2 Pictographs
Pictographs are one visual and suggestive way to represent data 
without writing any numbers. Look at this picture — you may be 
familiar with it from previous classes.  

 Modes of Travelling  Number of Students  = 1 Student

Private car        
Public bus           
School bus                      

Cycle       
Walking               

 This picture helps you understand at a glance the different 
modes of travel used by students. Based on this picture, answer the 
following questions:

79

Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   79 13/08/2024   15:33:12



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 

• Which mode of travel is used by the most number of students? 
• Which mode of travel is used by the least number of students? 
 A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps 
answer questions about data with just a quick glance. 
 In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol ( ) is used to represent 
one student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or 
symbol stands for many people or objects.

 Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of 
his middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least 
9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data:

Response Number of Children (  = 10 Children)

Always         

Sometimes     

Never        

Answer the following questions using the pictograph:
1.  What is the number of children who always slept at least 9 

hours at night?  
2.  How many children sometimes slept at least 9 hours at night?
3. How many children always slept less than 9 hours each night? 

Explain how you got your answer.

Solutions 
1.   In the table, there are 5 pictures  for ‘Always’. Each picture 

 represents 10 children. Therefore, 5 pictures indicate 
5 × 10 = 50 children.

2. There are 2 complete pictures  (2 × 10 = 20) and a half 
picture  (half of 10 = 5). Therefore, the number of children 
who sleep at least 9 hours only sometimes is 20 + 5 = 25.

80

Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   80 13/08/2024   15:33:12



Data Handling and Presentation

3. There are 4 complete pictures for ‘Never’. Hence, 4 × 10 = 
40 children never sleep at least 9 hours in a night, i.e., they 
always sleep less than 9 hours.

Drawing a Pictograph
One day, Lakhanpal collected data on how many students were 
absent in each class:

Class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
No. of 

students 3 5 4 2 0 1 5 7

  He created a pictograph to present this data and decided to show 
1 student as  in the pictograph —

 If they want to show their data through a pictograph, where they 
also use one symbol  for each student, as Lakhanpal did, what are 
the challenges they might face? 
 Jarina made a plan to address this — since there were many 
students, she decided to use  to represent 5 students. She figured 
that would save time and space too.

realised she could use to show 5 students.

•  Pictographs are a nice visual and suggestive way to represent 
data. They represent data through pictures of objects. 

•  Pictographs can help answer questions and make inferences 
about data with just a quick glance (in the examples above— 
about favourite games, favourite colours, most common modes 
of conveyance, number of students absent, etc.). 

•  By reading a pictograph, we can quickly understand the 
frequencies of the different categories (for example, cricket, 
hockey, etc.) and the comparisons of these frequencies.

•  In a pictograph, the categories can be arranged horizontlly or 
vertically. For each category, simple pictures and symbols are 
then drawn in the designated columns or rows according to the 
frequency of that category. 

• A  scale or key (for example,  : 1 student or  : 5 students) 
is added to show what each symbol or picture represents. Each 
symbol or picture can represent one unit or multiple units.

•  It can be more challenging to prepare a pictograph when the 
amount of data is large or when the frequencies are not exact 
multiples of the scale or key.

4.3 Bar Graphs
Have you seen graphs 
like this on TV or in a 
newspaper?
 Like pictographs, such 
bar graphs can help us to 
quickly understand and 
interpret information, 
such as the highest value, 
the comparison of values 
of different categories, etc. 
However, when the amount 
of data is large, presenting 
it by a pictograph is not 
only time consuming but Source: https://www.statista.com/chart/17122/

If the students have not noticed, please point out the equally spaced 
horizontal lines. Explain that this means that each pair of consecutive 
numbers on the left has the same gap. 

 Answer the following questions using the bar graph:
1. In Class 2, ___________ students were absent that day.
2.  In which class were the maximum number of students absent?

3. Which class had full attendance that day? ___________
 When making bar graphs, bars of uniform width can be drawn 
horizontally or vertically with equal spacing between them; then the

length or height of each bar represents the given number. As we saw in 
pictographs, we can use a scale or key when the frequencies are larger. 
 Let us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing 
in Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day. 
The number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from 
6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph. One unit of length 
stands for 100 vehicles.

11–12
10–11

9–10
8–9

7–8
6–7

Number of vehicles

 We can see that the maximum traffic at the crossing is shown 
by the longest bar, i.e., for the time interval 7–8 a.m. The bar graph 
shows that 1200 vehicles passed through the crossing at that time. 
The second longest bar is for 8–9 a.m. During that time, 1000 vehicles 
passed through the crossing. Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown 
by the smallest bar, i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During 
that time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The 
second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon, 
when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing.
 The total number of cars passing through the crossing during the 
two-hour interval 8.00–10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about 
1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles.

and noon? 
2.  Why do you think so little traffic occurred during the hour of 

6–7 a.m., as compared to the other hours from 7 a.m.–noon?
3.  Why do you think the traffic was the heaviest between 7–8 a.m.?
4. Why do you think the traffic was lesser and lesser each hour after 

8 a.m. all the way until noon?

be difficult! Therefore, we choose the scale so that 1 unit represents 
10 crores. The bar graph for this choice is shown in the figure. So a 
bar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents 
80 crores.
• On the basis of this bar graph, what may be a few questions you 

may ask your friends?
• How much did the population of India increase over 50 years? 

How much did the population increase in each decade?

4.4 Drawing a Bar Graph
In a previous example, Shri Nilesh prepared a frequency table 
representing the sweet preferences of the students in his class. Let’s 
try to prepare a bar graph to present his data —
1.  First, we draw a horizontal 

line and a vertical line. On Sweet No. of Students

the horizontal line, we will Jalebi 6
write the name of each of Gulab jamun 9
the sweets, equally spaced, Gujiya 13
from which the bars will Barfi 3
rise in accordance with 
their frequencies; and on Rasgulla 7

the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the 
number of students. 

2. We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many 
students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that 
it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to 
represent 1 student. 

3. For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 
units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly 
for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their 
frequencies. 

89

Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd   89 13/08/2024   15:33:14

 When the frequencies are larger and we cannot use the scale of 
1 unit length = 1 number (frequency), we need to choose a different 
scale like we did in the case of pictographs. 

Example: The number of runs scored by Smriti in each of the 
8 matches are given in the table below:

Match Match Match Match Match Match Match Match Match 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Runs 80 50 10 100 90 0 90 50

 In this example, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score 
is 100. Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we 
have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would 
be unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit 
length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw 
the bars according to the scores in each match. We get the following 
bar graph representing the above data.

Example: The following table shows the monthly expenditure of 
Imran’s family on various items:

Items Expenditure (in `)

House rent 3000
Food 3400
Education  800
Electricity  400
Transport  600
Miscellaneous  1200

 To represent this data in the form of a bar graph, here are the steps —
• Draw two perpendicular lines, one horizontal and one vertical. 
• Along the horizontal line, mark the ‘items’ with equal spacing 

between them and mark the corresponding expenditures along 
the vertical line.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 

•  Take bars of the same width, keeping a uniform gap between them. 
•  Choose a suitable scale along the vertical line. Let, 1 unit length = 

` 200, and then mark and write the corresponding values (` 200, 
` 400, etc.) representing each unit length.

 Finally, calculate the heights of the bars for various items as 
shown below — 

House rent 3000 ÷ 200 15 units
Food 3400 ÷ 200 17 units

Education  800 ÷ 200 4 units
Electricity  400 ÷ 200 2 units
Transport  600 ÷ 200 3 units

Miscellaneous  1200 ÷ 200 6 units

•  Like pictographs, bar graphs give a nice visual way to represent 
data. They represent data through equally-spaced bars, each of 
equal width, where the lengths or heights give frequencies of the 
different categories. 

•  Each category is represented by a bar where the length or height 
depicts the corresponding frequency (for example, cost) or 
quantity (for example, runs). 

•  The bars have uniform spaces between them to indicate that they 
are free standing and represent equal categories.

•  The bars help in interpreting data much faster than a frequency 
table. By reading a bar graph, we can compare frequencies of 
different categories at a glance.

•  We must decide the scale (for example,  1 unit length = 1 student 
or 1 unit length = ` 200) for a bar graph on the basis of the data 
including the minimum and maximum frequencies, so that the 
resulting bar graph fits nicely and looks visually appealing on the 
paper or poster we are preparing. The markings of the unit lengths 
as per the scale must start from zero.

Teacher’s Note 
The main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find 
answers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to 
take specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing 
practice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data.

4.5 Artistic and Aesthetic Considerations
In addition to the steps described in previous sections, there are 
also some other more artistic and aesthetic aspects one can consider 
when preparing visual presentations of data to make them more 
interesting and effective. First, when making a visual presentation 
of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make 
it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by 
choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also 
desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and 
easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the 
information being conveyed.
 Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest 
mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain 
in meters.

Continent Asia South North 
America America Africa Europe Antarctica Australia

Tallest Kiliman- Vinson 
Everest Aconcagua Denali Elbrus Koscuiszko

Mountain jaro Massif

Height 8848m 6962m 6194m 5895m 5642m 4892m 2228m

 How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are 
Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This 
is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers.
 As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers 
into a bar graph, as shown on the right.  Here, each value is drawn 
as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the 
number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights 
of all these mountains at a glance.

 However, since the boxes represent heights, it is better and more 
visually appealing to rotate the picture, so that the boxes grow 
upward, vertically from the ground like mountains. A bar graph 
with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the 
pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof. 
 Below is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains. From 
this column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the 
heights of the mountains.

Data Handling and Presentation

 In general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing 
to represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground, 
using bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly, 
lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances 
between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar 
graphs with horizontal arcs. 

 Figure it Out
1. If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the 

tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph 
with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?

2.  If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent 
and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with 
vertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this 
information, and then make the corresponding table and bar 
graph! Which continents have the longest rivers?

Infographics
When data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified 
with more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called 
information graphics or infographics for short.  The aim of 
infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging 
visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, 
in a visually pleasing way. 
 As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate 
data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing 
the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with 
vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more 
indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use 
triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a 
splash of colour as well. Here is the result.

 While this infographic might look more appealing and suggestive at 
first glance, it does have some issues. The goal of our bar graph earlier 
was to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the 
appropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the 
same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights. 
However, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are 
taller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional 
information that may be misleading and may or may not be correct. 
Sometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally 
mislead.
 Taking this idea further, and to make the picture even more visually 
stimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the 
mountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add 
other details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example, 
we can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these 
mountains.
 Is the infographic below better than the column graph with 
rectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more 
realistic, but is the picture accurate? 
 For example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus.

Data Handling and Presentation

The seven highest peaks on 
the seven continents.

 What is 5642 × 2? 
 While preparing visually-appealing presentations of data, we 
also need to be careful that the pictures we draw do not mislead us 
about the facts. In general, it is important to be careful when making 
or reading infographics, so that we do not mislead our intended 
audiences and we, ourselves, are not misled. 

Summary
 Facts, numbers, measures, observations and other descriptions of 

things that convey information about those things is called data.
 Data can be organised in a tabular form using tally marks for easy 

analysis and interpretation. 
 Frequencies are the counts of the occurrences of values, measures or 

observations.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 

 Pictographs represent data in the form of pictures, or objects or parts 
of objects. Each picture represents a frequency which can be 1 or more 
than 1 — this is called the scale and it must be specified. 

 Bar graphs have bars of uniform width; the length or height that 
indicates the total frequency of occurrence. The scale that is used to 
convert length or height to frequency again, must be specified. 

 Choosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is 
important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information 
or data and to also make it visually appealing.

 Other aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual 
appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures 
are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These 
aspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling 
and presentation. 

 However, making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also 
sometimes be misleading.

 By reading pictographs and bar graphs accurately, we can quickly 
understand and make inferences about the data presented.

5 PRIME TIME

5.1 Common Multiples and Common Factors

Idli-Vada Game
Children sit in a circle and play a game of numbers.

One of the children starts by saying ‘1’. The second 
player says ‘2’, and so on. But when it is the turn of 3, 6, 
9, … (multiples of 3), the player should say ‘idli’ instead 
of the number. When it is the turn of 5, 10, … (multiples 
of 5), the player should say ‘vada’ instead of the number. 
When a number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple 
of 5, the player should say ‘idli-vada’! If a player makes 
any mistake, they are out.

The game continues in rounds till only one person 
remains.

For which numbers should the players say ‘idli’ 
instead of saying the number? These would be 3, 6, 9, 
12, 18, … and so on.

For which numbers should the players say ‘vada’? 
These would be 5, 10, 20, … and so on.

Which is the first number for which the players 
should say, ‘idli-vada’? It is 15, which is a multiple of 3, 
and also a multiple of 5. Find out other such numbers 
that are multiples of both 3 and 5. These numbers are 
called _____________________________.

with different pairs of numbers: Fig. 5.1
a. 2 and 5, 
b. 3 and 7, 
c. 4 and 6. 
We will say ‘idli’ for multiples of the smaller number, ‘vada’ for 

multiples of the larger number and ‘idli-vada’ for common multiples. 
Draw a figure similar to Fig. 5.1 if the game is played up to 60.

Yesterday, we played this game  
with two numbers. We ended  
up saying just ‘idli’ or ‘idli-vada’ Oh, what could  
and nobody said just ‘vada’! those numbers be!? 

One of the numbers 
was 4.

  Which of the following could be the other number:
 2, 3, 5, 8, 10?

Jump Jackpot
Jumpy and Grumpy play a game.

•  Grumpy places a treasure on some number. For example, he 
may place it on 24.

•  Jumpy chooses a jump size. If he chooses 4, then he has to 
jump only on multiples of 4, starting at 0.

•  Jumpy gets the treasure if he lands on the number where 
Grumpy placed it.

Which jump sizes will get Jumpy to land on 24?
If he chooses 4: Jumpy lands on 4 → 8 → 12 → 16 → 20 → 24 → 28 → ...
Other successful jump sizes are 2, 3, 6, 8 and 12.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24

What about the jump of sizes 1 and 24? Yes, they also will land 
on 24.

The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 all divide 24 exactly. Recall that 
such numbers are called factors or divisors of 24.

Grumpy increases the level of the game. Two treasures are kept 
on two different numbers. Jumpy has to choose a jump size and stick 
to it. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he lands on both the numbers 
with the chosen jump size. As before, Jumpy starts at 0.

Grumpy has kept the treasures on 14 and 36. And, Jumpy chooses 
a jump size of 7.

Will Jumpy land on both the treasures? Starting from 0, he jumps 
to 7 → 14 → 21 → 28 → 35 → 42 … We see that he landed on 14 but 

109

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

did not land on 36, so he does not get the treasure. What jump size 
should he have chosen?

The factors of 14 are: 1, 2, 7, 14. So, these jump sizes will land on 14.
The factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36. These jump sizes 

will land on 36.
So, the jump sizes of 1 or 2 will land on both 14 and 36. Notice that 

1 and 2 are the common factors of 14 and 36.
The jump sizes using which both the treasures can be reached are 

the common factors of the two numbers where the treasures are 
placed.

  What jump size can reach both 15 and 30? There are multiple 
jump sizes possible. Try to find them all.

5.2 Prime Numbers
Guna and Anshu want to pack figs (anjeer) that grow in their farm. 
Guna wants to put 12 figs in each box and Anshu wants to put 7 figs 
in each box.
How many arrangements are possible?

Think and find out the different ways how —
 1. Guna can arrange 12 figs in a rectangular manner. 
 2. Anshu can arrange 7 figs in a rectangular manner. 
Guna has listed out these possibilities.
Observe the number of rows and 

columns in each of the arrangements. 
How are they related to 12?

In the second arrangement, for 
example, 12 figs are arranged in two 
columns of 6 each or 12 = 2 × 6.

Anshu could make only one 
arrangement: 7 × 1 or 1 × 7. There are 
no other rectangular arrangements 
possible.

In each of Guna’s arrangements, 
multiplying the number of rows by 
the number of columns gives the 
number 12. So, the number of rows 
or columns are factors of 12.

We saw that the number 12 can be arranged in a rectangle in 
more than one way as 12 has more than two factors. The number 7 
can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors — 1 and 7.

Numbers that have only two factors are called prime numbers or 
primes. Here are the first few primes — 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Notice 
that the factors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.

What about numbers that have more than two factors? They 
are called composite numbers. The first few composite numbers 
are — 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20.

What about 1, which has only one factor? The number 1 is neither 
a prime nor a composite number.

 How many prime numbers are there from 21 to 30? How many 
composite numbers are there from 21 to 30?
Can we list all the prime numbers from 1 to 100?
Here is an interesting way to find prime numbers. Just follow the 
steps given below and see what happens.
Step 1: Cross out 1 because it is neither prime nor composite.
Step 2: Circle 2, and then cross 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
out all multiples of 2 after that, 
i.e., 4, 6, 8, and so on. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

Step 3: You will find that the 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

next uncrossed number is 3. 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
Circle 3 and then cross out all 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
the multiples of 3 after that, 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60
i.e., 6, 9, 12, and so on. 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70
Step 4: The next uncrossed 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80
number is 5. Circle 5 and then 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90
cross out all the multiples of 5 

91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
after that, i.e., 10, 15, 20, and 
so on.
Step 5: Continue this process till all the numbers in the list are either 
circled or crossed out.

All the circled numbers are prime It is definitely not some  

numbers. All the crossed out numbers, magic; there should be a  
reason why it works.

other than 1, are composite numbers. This 
method is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

This procedure can be carried on 
for numbers greater than 100 also. 
Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician 
who lived around 2200 years ago and 
developed this method of listing primes.

Guna and Anshu started wondering how this simple method is able 
to find prime numbers! Think how this method works. Read the steps 
given above again and see what happens after each step is carried out.

 Figure it Out
1.  We see that 2 is a prime and also an even number. Is there any 

other even prime?
2.  Look at the list of primes till 100. What is the smallest difference 

between two successive primes? What is the largest difference?
3.  Are there an equal number of primes occurring in every row in the 

table on the previous page? Which decades have the least number 
of primes? Which have the most number of primes?

Primes through the Ages
Prime numbers are the building blocks of all whole numbers. Starting 
from the time of the Greek civilisation (more than 2000 years ago) to 
this day, mathematicians are still struggling to uncover their secrets!

Food for thought: is there a largest prime number? Or does the 
list of prime numbers go on without an end? A mathematician named 
Euclid found the answer and so will you in a later class!

Fun fact: The largest prime number that anyone has ‘written down’ 
is so large that it would take around 6500 pages to write it! So they 
could only write it on a computer!

4.  Which of the following numbers are prime: 23, 51, 37, 26?
5.  Write three pairs of prime numbers less than 20 whose sum is a 

multiple of 5.
6.  The numbers 13 and 31 are prime numbers. Both these numbers have 

same digits 1 and 3. Find such pairs of prime numbers up to 100.
7. Find seven consecutive composite numbers between 1 and 100.
8. Twin primes are pairs of primes having a difference of 2. For 

example, 3 and 5 are twin primes. So are 17 and 19. Find the other 
twin primes between 1 and 100.

a. There is no prime number whose units digit is 4.
b. A product of primes can also be prime.
c. Prime numbers do not have any factors.
d. All even numbers are composite numbers.
e. 2 is a prime and so is the next number, 3. For every other

10. Which of the following numbers is the product of exactly three 

distinct prime numbers: 45, 60, 91, 105, 330?
11. How many three-digit prime numbers can you make using each 

of 2, 4 and 5 once?
12. Observe that 3 is a prime number, and 2 × 3 + 1 = 7 is also a prime. 

Are there other primes for which doubling and adding 1 gives 
another prime? Find at least five such examples.

5.3 Co-prime numbers for safekeeping treasures
Which pairs are safe?
Let us go back to the treasure finding game. This time, treasures are 
kept on two numbers. Jumpy gets the treasures only if he is able to 
reach both the numbers with the same jump size. There is also a 
new rule — a jump size of 1 is not allowed.

 Where should Grumpy place the treasures so that Jumpy cannot 
reach both the treasures?

Will placing the treasure on 12 and 26 work? No! If the jump size 
is chosen to be 2, then Jumpy will reach both 12 and 26.

What about 4 and 9? Jumpy cannot reach both using any jump size 
other than 1. So, Grumpy knows that the pair 4 and 9 is safe.

Check if these pairs are safe:
a. 15 and 39  b. 4 and 15 
c. 18 and 29  d. 20 and 55

115

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

What is special about safe pairs? They don’t have any common 
factor other than 1. Two numbers are said to be co-prime to each 
other if they have no common factor other than 1.
Example: As 15 and 39 have 3 as a common factor, they are not 
co-prime. But 4 and 9 are co-prime.

 Which of the following pairs of numbers are co-prime?
a. 18 and 35 b. 15 and 37  c. 30 and 415
d. 17 and 69 e. 81 and 18

  While playing the ‘idli-vada’ game with different number 
pairs, Anshu observed something interesting! Math 

1.  Sometimes the first common multiple was the same Talk
as the product of the two numbers.

2.  At other times the first common multiple was less 
than the product of the two numbers.

 Find examples for each of the above. How is it related to the 
number pair being co-prime?
Co-prime art

pegs and the thread is tied to every fourth peg (we say that Math 
the thread-gap is 4). The second diagram has 13 pegs and the Talk

pictures, share and discuss your findings in class.

thread-gap) being co-prime?

5.4 Prime Factorisation
Checking if two numbers are co-prime
Teacher:  Are 56 and 63 co-prime?
Anshu and Guna:  If they have a common factor other than 1, then 

they are not co-prime. Let us check.
Anshu:  I can write 56 = 14 × 4 and 63 = 21 × 3. So, 14 and 4 

are factors, of 56. Further, 21 and 3 are factors of 
63. So, there are no common factors. The numbers 
are co-prime.

Guna:  Hold on. I can also write 56 = 7 × 8 and 63 = 9 × 7. 
We see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they 
are not co-prime.

Clearly Guna is right, as 7 is a common factor. 
 But where did Anshu go wrong? 
Writing 56 = 14 × 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it 

does not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63.
Try another example: 80 and 63. There are many ways to factorise 

both numbers.
80 = 40 × 2 = 20 × 4 = 10 × 8 = 16 × 5 = ???
63 = 9 × 7 = 3 × 21 = ???
We have written ‘???’ to say that there may be more ways to 

factorise these numbers. But if we take any of the given factorisations, 
for example, 80 = 16 × 5 and 63 = 9 × 7, then there are no common 
factors. Can we conclude that 80 and 63 are co-prime? As Anshu’s 
mistake above shows, we cannot conclude that as there may be other 
ways to factorise the numbers.

What this means is that we need a more systematic approach to 
check if two numbers are co-prime.

Prime factorisation
Take a number such as 56. It is composite, as we saw that it can be 
written as 56 = 4 × 14 . So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one 
of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 × 7. 
Therefore, 56 = 4 × 2 × 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as 
4 = 2 × 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. All the factors appearing here, 2 
and 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further.

In conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers. 
This is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are 
called prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7.

Every number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea 
is the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till 
only primes are left.

The number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not 
divisible by any prime number.

What is the prime factorisation of a prime number like 7? It is just 
7 (we cannot break it down any further).

Let us see a few more examples.
By going through different ways of breaking down the number, 

we wrote 63 as 3 × 3 × 7 and as 3 × 7 × 3. Are they different? Not 
really! The same prime numbers 3 and 7 occur in both cases. Further, 
3 appears two times in 36
both and 7 appears once.

Here, you see four 
different ways to get 2×18 3×12 4×9 6×6

prime factorisation of 36. 2×2×9 3×3×4 2×2×9 2×3×6
Observe that in all four 2×2×3×3 3×3×2×2 2×2×3×3 2×3×2×3
cases, we get two 2s and 

2×2×3×3

that you get 36 in all four cases.

For any number, it is a remarkable fact that there is only one prime 
factorisation, except that the prime factors may come in different

orders. As we explain below, the order is not important. However, 
as we saw in these examples, there are many ways to arrive at the 
prime factorisation!

Does the order matter? 

Using this diagram,
can you explain why 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, no matter which way you multiply 
2, 3, and 5?

When multiplying numbers, we can do so in any order. The 
end result is the same. That is why, when two 2s and two 3s are 
multiplied in any order, we get 36. In a later class, we shall study 
this under the names of commutativity and associativity of 
multiplication. 

Thus, the order does not matter. Usually we write the prime 
numbers in increasing order. For example, 225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 or 30 = 
2 × 3 × 5.

Prime factorisation of a product of two numbers
When we find the prime factorisation of a number, we first write 
it as a product of two factors. For example, 72 = 12 × 6. Then, we 
find the prime factorisation of each of the factors. In the above example, 
12 = 2 × 2 × 3 and 6 = 2 × 3. Now, can you say what the prime factorisation 
of 72 is?

The prime factorisation of the original number is obtained by 
putting these together.

72 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 3

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

We can also write this as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3. Multiply and check that 
you get 72 back!

Observe how many times each prime factor occurs in the 
factorisation of 72.

Compare it with how many times it occurs in the factorisations of 
12 and 6 put together.

1. Find the prime factorisations of the following numbers: 64, 104, 

105, 243, 320, 141, 1728, 729, 1024, 1331, 1000.

3. Find three prime numbers, all less than 30, whose product is 1955.
4. Find the prime factorisation of these numbers without multiplying

5. What is the smallest number whose prime factorisation has:
 a. three different prime numbers? 
 b. four different prime numbers? 

Prime factorisation is of fundamental importance in the study of 
numbers. Let us discuss two ways in which it can be useful.

Using prime factorisation to check if two numbers are co-prime
 Let us again take the numbers 56 and 63. How can we check if they 
are co-prime? We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers —

56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7
Now, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore, 

56 and 63 are not co-prime.
What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows:

80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7
There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they 

are co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite. 
Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in 
the prime factorisation of 80 and 63?

120

Chapter 5_Prime Time.indd   120 13-08-2024   17:20:37



Prime Time 

Therefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors, 
then the two numbers are co-prime.

Let us see some examples.
Example:  Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as 

follows:
40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 231 = 3 × 7 × 11

We see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and 
231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime 
factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime!
Example:  Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as 

follows:
242 = 2 × 11 × 11 and 195 = 3 × 5 × 13

The prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195 
are 3, 5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242 
and 195 are co-prime.

Using prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible 
by another
We can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime 
factorisation of the second number is included in the prime 
factorisation of the first number.

We say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12, 
the remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible 
by another without carrying out long division?
Example: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:

168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3
Since we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that,

 168 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 7 = 12 × 14
Therefore, 168 is divisible by 12.

Example: Is 75 divisible by 21? Find the prime factorisations of both:
75 = 3 × 5 × 5 and 21 = 3 × 7

121

Chapter 5_Prime Time.indd   121 13-08-2024   17:20:37



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

As we saw in the discussion above, if 75 was a multiple of 21, then 
all prime factors of 21 would also be prime factors of 75. However, 7 
is a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is 
not divisible by 21.
Example: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both:

42 = 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3
All prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime 

factorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42. 
This is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but 
only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not 
divisible by 12.

We can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the 
prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime 
factorisation of the first number.

5.5 Divisibility Tests
So far, we have been finding factors of numbers in different contexts, 
including to determine if a number is prime or not, or if a given pair 
of numbers is co-prime or not.

It is easy to find factors of small numbers. How do we find factors 
of a large number?

Let us take 8560. Does it have any factors from 2 to 10 (2, 3, 4, 
5, ..., 9, 10)?

It is easy to check if some of these numbers are factors or not 
without doing long division. Can you find them?

Divisibility by 10
Let us take 10. Is 8560 divisible by 10? This is another way of  
asking if 10 is a factor of 8560.

For this, we can look at the pattern in the multiples of 10.
The first few multiples of 10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, … Continue this 

sequence and observe the pattern.

What are all the multiples of 2 between 399 and 411?

Divisibility by 4
Checking if a number is divisible by 4 can also be done easily!

Look at its multiples: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, …
Are you able to observe any patterns that can be used? The 

multiples of 10, 5 and 2 have a pattern in their last digits which we 
are able to use to check for divisibility. Similarly, can we check if a 
number is divisible by 4 by looking at the last digit?

It does not work! Look at 12 and 22. They have the same last digit, 
but 12 is a multiple of 4 while 22 is not. Similarly 14 and 24 have the 
same last digit, but 14 is not a multiple of 4 while 24 is. Similarly, 16 
and 26 or 18 and 28. What this means is that by looking at the last 
digit, we cannot tell whether a number is a multiple of 4.

Can we answer the question by looking at more digits? Make a list 
of multiples of 4 between 1 and 200 and search for a pattern.

 Find numbers between 330 and 340 that are divisible by 4. Also, 
find numbers between 1730 and 1740, and 2030 and 2040, that are 
divisible by 4. What do you observe?

 Is 8536 divisible by 4?
 Consider these statements:

1. Only the last two digits matter when deciding if a given 
number is divisible by 4.

2.	 If the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4, 
then the original number is divisible by 4.

3.	 If the original number is divisible by 4, then the number 
formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4.

Divisibility by 8
Interestingly, even checking for divisibility by 8 can be simplified. 
Can the last two digits be used for this?

 Find numbers between 120 and 140 that are divisible by 8. Also 
find numbers between 1120 and 1140, and 3120 and 3140, that are 
divisible by 8. What do you observe?

 Change the last two digits of 8560 so that the resulting number is 
a multiple of 8.

 Consider these statements:
1. Only the last three digits matter when deciding if a 

given number is divisible by 8. Math 
Talk

2. If the number formed by the last three digits is divisible 
by 8, then the original number is divisible by 8.

3. If the original number is divisible by 8, then the number 
formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8.

Do you agree? Why or why not?
We have seen that long division is not always needed to check if a 

number is a factor or not. We have made use of certain observations 
to come up with simple methods for 10, 5, 2, 4, 8. Do we have such 
simple methods for other numbers as well? We will discuss simple 
methods to test divisibility by 3, 6, 7, and 9 in later classes!

 If a number is divisible by another, the second number is called a factor 
of the first. For example, 4 is a factor of 12 because 12 is divisible by 4 
(12 ÷ 4 = 3).

 Prime numbers are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … that have only two 
factors, namely 1 and themselves.

 Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, … that have more 
than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For 
example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both 
composite.

 Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime 
numbers. This is called the number’s prime factorisation. For example, 
84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.

 There is only one way to factorise a number into primes, except for 
the ordering of the factors.

 Two numbers that do not have a common factor other than 1 are said 
to be co-prime.

 To check if two numbers are co-prime, we can first find their prime 
factorisations and check if there is a common prime factor. If there is no 
common prime factor, they are co-prime, and otherwise they are not.

 A number is a factor of another number if the prime factorisation of 
the first number is included in the prime factorisation of the second 
number.

6 PERIMETER AND AREA

6.1  Perimeter
Do you remember what the perimeter of a closed plane figure is? 
Let us refresh our understanding! 
 The perimeter of any closed plane figure is the distance covered 
along its boundary when you go around it once. For a polygon, i.e., 
a closed plane figure made up of line segments, the perimeter is 
simply the sum of the lengths of its all sides, i.e., the total distance 
along its outer boundary.
 The perimeter of a polygon = the sum of the lengths of its all sides.
 Let us revise the formulas for the perimeter of rectangles, squares, 
and triangles.

Perimeter of a rectangle
Consider a rectangle ABCD whose length and breadth are 12 cm and 
8 cm, respectively. What is its perimeter? 
Perimeter of the rectangle =  Sum of the lengths of its four sides
       = AB + BC + CD + DA 

A 12 cm B

D C

Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd   129 13-08-2024   16:16:29

8 cm



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

    = AB + BC + AB + BC 
    = 2 × AB + 2 × BC Opposite sides of a 

rectangle are always 
    = 2 × (AB + BC) equal. So, AB = CD and 
    = 2 × (12 cm + 8 cm)  AD = BC
    = 2 × (20 cm) 
    = 40 cm.
From this example, we see that —
Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth.
Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth).
 The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth.

Perimeter of a square 1 m

Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around 
a square photo frame of side 1m as shown. 
What will be the length of the coloured tape 
he requires? Since Debojeet wants to put the 
coloured tape all around the square photo 
frame, he needs to find the perimeter of the 
photo frame. 
 Thus, the length of the tape required = 
perimeter of the square 
 = sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square 
 = 1 m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m.
 Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length. 
Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply 
multiply the length of one side by 4. 
  Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m. 
 From this example, we see that

Perimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side.
 The perimeter of a square is quadruple the length of its side.

Perimeter of a triangle
Consider a triangle having three given sides of  
lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 7 cm. Find its perimeter. 5 cm 

Perimeter of the triangle = 4 cm + 5 cm + 7 cm
         = 16 cm. 7 cm 

Perimeter of a triangle = sum of the lengths of its three sides. 

Example: Akshi wants to put lace all around a 
rectangular tablecloth that is 3 m long and 2 m 
wide. Find the length of the lace required.

Solution
  Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m.
  Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m.
  Akshi wants to put lace all around the 

tablecloth. 
  Therefore, the length of the lace required will be the perimeter of the 

rectangular tablecloth.
  Now, the perimeter of the rectangular tablecloth = 2 × (length + breadth) 
  = 2 × (3 m + 2 m) = 2 × 5 m = 10 m.
  Hence, the length of the lace required is 10 m.

Example: Find the distance travelled by Usha if she takes three rounds of 
a square park of side 75 m.

Solution
  Perimeter of the square park = 4 × length 

of a side = 4 × 75 m = 300 m.
  Distance covered by Usha in one  

round = 300 m. 
  Therefore, the total distance travelled by 

Usha in three rounds = 3 × 300 m = 900 m.

f.  Now, Toshi ran 1000 m. How many full rounds has she finished 
running around her track? Mark her position as ‘Z’.

  Deep Dive: In races, usually there is a common finish line for all 
the runners. Here are two square running tracks with the inner track 
of 100 m each side and outer track of 150 m each side. The common 
finishing line for both runners is shown by 150 m
the flags in the figure which are in the center 
of one of the sides of the tracks.

100 m
 If the total race is of 350 m, then we have 
to find out where the starting positions of the 
two runners should be on these two tracks so 
that they both have a common finishing line 
after they run for 350 m. Mark the starting 
points of the runner on the inner track as ‘A’ Common Finishing Line
and the runner on the outer track as ‘B’.

 Estimate and Verify
Take a rough sheet of paper or a sheet of newspaper. 
Make a few random shapes by cutting the paper 
in different ways. Estimate the total length of the 
boundaries of each shape then use a scale or measuring 
tape to measure and verify the perimeter for each 
shape.

 Akshi says that the perimeter of this triangle shape is 9 units. 
Toshi says it can’t be 9 units and the perimeter will be more than 9 
units. What do you think?

No, it will be more 
The perimeter is than 9 units.

9 units.

Perimeter and Area

6.2  Area
We have studied the areas of closed figures (regular and irregular) 
in previous grades. Let us recall some key points.

The amount of region enclosed by a closed figure is called its area.
 In previous grades, we arrived at the formula for the area of a 
rectangle and a square using square grid paper. Do you remember?

Area of a square =  ________  Area of a rectangle =  _______

Teacher’s Note 
Help students in recalling the method of finding the area of a 
rectangle and a square using grid papers. Provide square grid 
papers to students and let them come up with the formula.

 Let’s see some real-life problems related to these ideas.
Example: A floor is 5 m long and 4 m wide. A square carpet of sides 3 m 
is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted.
Solution
Length of the floor = 5 m.
Width of the floor = 4 m.
Area of the floor = length × width = 5 m × 4 m = 20 sq m.
Length of the square carpet = 3 m.
Area of the carpet = length × length = 3 m × 3 m = 9 sq m.
Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m.
 Therefore, the area of the floor that is not carpeted is: area of the floor 
minus the area of the floor laid with carpet = 20 sq m – 9 sq m = 11 sq m.

Example: Four square flower beds each of side 4 m are in four corners 
on a piece of land 12 m long and 10 m wide. Find the area of the remaining 
part of the land. 

137

Chapter 6_Perimeter and Area.indd   137 13-08-2024   16:16:31



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Solution
Length of the land (l) = 12 m.
Width of land (w) = 10 m.
Area of the whole land = l × w = 12 m × 10 m = 120 sq m.
The sidelength of each of the four square flower beds is (s) = 4 m.
Area of one flower bed = s × s = 4 m × 4 m = 16 sq m.
Hence, the area of the four flower beds = 4 × 16 sq m = 64 sq m.
 Therefore, the area of the remaining part of the land is: area of the complete 
land minus the area of all four flower beds = 120 sq m – 64 sq m = 56 sq m.

 Figure it Out
1.  The area of a rectangular garden 25 m long is 300 sq m. What is

 Look at the figures below and guess which one of them has a 
larger area.

a. b.

 We can estimate the area of any simple closed shape by using a 
sheet of squared paper or graph paper where every square measures 
1 unit × 1 unit or 1 square unit.
 To estimate the area, we can trace the shape onto a piece of 
transparent paper and place the same on a piece of squared or graph 
paper and then follow the below conventions —
1. The area of one full small square of the squared or graph paper 

is taken as 1 sq unit. 
2. Ignore portions of the area that are less than half a square. 
3.  If more than half of a square is in a region, just count it as 1 sq unit.
4.  If exactly half the square is counted, take its area as 1  sq unit.

the squares and use them to estimate 
the area of the circular region. 
 As you can see, circles can’t 
be packed tightly without gaps in 
between. So, it is difficult to get 
an accurate measurement of area 
using circles as units. Here, the 
same rectangle is packed in two 
different ways with circles — the 
first one has 42 circles and the second one has 44 circles.

 Try using different shapes (triangle and rectangle) to fill the 
given space (without overlaps and gaps) and find out the merits 
associated with using a square shape to find the area rather than 
another shape. List out the points that make a square the best shape 
to use to measure area.

Cut the rectangle along that diagonal and get two triangles. 

 Check! whether the two triangles overlap each other exactly. 
Do they have the same area?
 Try this with more rectangles having different dimensions. You 
can check this for a square as well.

 Can you draw any inferences from this exercise? Please write it 
here.

the yellow triangle and their areas? Write the relationship here.
 

Teacher’s Note 
Help students in articulating their inferences and in defining the 
relationships they have observed in their own words, gradually 
leading to a common statement for whole classroom. Recall the 
definition of a diagonal in the classroom.

Making it ‘More’ or ‘Less’
Observe these two figures. Is there any similarity or difference 
between the two?

 Using 9 unit squares (having an area of 9 sq units), we have 
made figures with two different perimeters—the first figure has a 
perimeter of 12 units and the second has a perimeter of 20 units. 
 Arrange or draw different figures with 9 sq units to get other 
perimeters. Each square should align with at least one other square 
on at least one side completely and together all squares should form 
a single connected figure with no holes. 

 Using 9 unit squares, solve the following.
1. What is the smallest perimeter possible?
2. What is the largest perimeter possible?
3. Make a figure with a perimeter of 18 units.
4.  Can you make other shaped figures for each of the above three 

perimeters, or is there only one shape with that perimeter? 
What is your reasoning?

 Let’s do something tricky now! We have a figure below having 
perimeter 24 units.

again, observe, think and find 
out what will be the change in 
the perimeter if a new square is 
attached as shown on the right.

Summary
  The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
  a.   T he perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and 

width. 
  b.   T he perimeter of a square is four times the length of any one of its 

sides.
  The area of a closed figure is the measure of the region enclosed by 

the figure. 
  Area is generally measured in square units. 
  The area of a rectangle is its length times its width. The area of a square 

is the length of any one of its sides multiplied by itself.
  Two closed figures can have the same area with different perimeters, 

or the same perimeter with different areas. 
  Areas of regions can be estimated (or even determined exactly) by 

breaking up such regions into unit squares, or into more general-
shaped rectangles and triangles whose areas can be calculated.

Fractions

Recall that when some whole number of things are shared 
equally among some number of people, fractions tell us how 
much each share is.
Shabnam: D o you remember, if one roti is divided equally 

between two children, how much 
roti will each child get?

Mukta: Each child will get half a roti.
Shabnam: T he fraction ‘one half’ is written as 

1
2 . We also sometimes read this as 
‘one upon two.’

Mukta:  If one roti is equally shared among 
4 children, how much roti will one child get?

Shabnam: Each child’s share is 1
4 roti. 

Mukta: And which is more 1
2  roti or 1

4  roti? 
Shabnam: When 2 children share 1 roti 

equally, each child gets 1
2  roti. When 

4 children share 1 roti equally, each 
child gets 1

4  roti. Since, in the second 
group more children share the

same one roti, each child gets a smaller share. So, 1
2  roti is 

more than 1
4  roti. 1

2  > 1

7.1 Fractional Units and Equal Shares 
Beni: Which fraction is greater — 15 or 19?
Arvin: 9 is bigger than 5. So I would guess that 1

9  is greater 
than 1

5 . Am I right?
Beni: No! That is a common mistake. Think of these fractions 

as shares.
Arvin: If one roti is shared among 5 children, each one gets a 

share of 1
5  roti. If one roti is shared among 9 children, 

each one gets a share of 1
9  roti?

Beni: Exactly! Now think again - which share is higher?
Arvin: If I share with more people, I will get less. So, 1

9  < 1
5 .

Beni: You got it!

Oh, so 1
100  is bigger than 1

200!

When one unit is divided into several equal parts, each part is 
called a fractional unit. These are all fractional units: 
1

3 , 1
4 , 1

5 , 1
6 , …, 1

10 , …, 1

Fractions have been used and named in India since ancient times. 
In the Rig Veda, the fraction 3

words for fractions used today in many Indian languages go back to 
ancient times. 

 Find out and discuss the words for fractions that are used in the different 
languages spoken in your home, city, or state. Ask your grandparents,

7.3 Measuring Using Fractional Units
Take a strip of paper. We consider this paper strip to be one unit long.

Fold the strip into two equal parts and then open up the strip again. 
Taking the strip to be one unit in length, what are the lengths of the 
two new parts of the strip created by the crease?

We can describe how much the quantity is by collecting together the 
fractional units.

Reading Fractions

We usually read the fraction 34   as ‘three quarters’ or ‘three upon four’, 
but reading it as ‘3 times 1

4’ helps us to understand the size of the 
fraction because it clearly shows what the fractional unit is (1

4) and 
how many such fractional units (3) there are.

Recall what we call the top number and the bottom number of fractions. 
In the fraction 5 , 5 is the numerator and 6 is the denominator.

Teacher’s Note
Give several opportunities to the children to explore the idea of 
fractional units with different shapes like circles, squares, rectangles, 
triangles, etc.

7.4  Marking Fraction Lengths on the Number Line
We have marked lengths equal to 1, 2, 3, … units on the number line. 
Now, let us try to mark lengths equal to fractions on the number line. 

What is the length of the blue line? Write the fraction that gives 
the length of the blue line in the box.

0 1 2

The distance between 0 and 1 is one unit long. It is divided into 
two equal parts. So, the length of each part is 1

2  unit. So, this blue line 
is 1

2  unit long. 

 Now, canyoufind the lengthsof thevariousblue lines shown
below? Fill in the boxes as well. 
1. Here,thefractionalunitisdividingalengthof1unitintothree

equal parts. Write the fraction that gives the length of the blue 
line in the box or in your notebook.

2. Here,aunitisdividedinto5equalparts.Writethefractionthat
gives the length of the blue lines in the respective boxes or in 
your notebook.

5 5

3.  Now, a unit is divided into 8 equal parts. Write the appropriate 
fractions in your notebook.

7.5 Mixed Fractions
Fractions greater than one
You marked some fractions on the number line earlier. Did you 
notice that the lengths of all the blue lines were less than one and 
the lengths of all the black lines were more than 1?

 Write down all the fractions you marked on the number line 
earlier. 
 Now, let us classify these in two groups: 

Lengths less than 1 unit Lengths more than 1 unit

 Did you notice something common between the fractions that 
are greater than 1?

In all the fractions that are less than 1 unit, the numerator is 
smaller than the denominator, while in the fractions that are more 
than 1 unit, the numerator is larger than the denominator.

We know that 3
2 , 5

2  and 7
2  are all greater than 1 unit. But can we 

see how many whole units they contain?
3
2  = 1

2  + 1

2  = 1 + 1

5
2  = 1

I know that 13 + 13 + 13 = 33 = 1. If I add one more 13, 

I will get more than 1 unit! So, 43 > 1.

3  + 1

3  + 1
3  + 1

3  = 1 + 1

Shabnam:  There is a condition. The fractional unit used for the two 
fractions have to be the same! Like 2

6 and 3
6 both use the 

same fractional unit 16 (i.e., the denominators are the same). 
But 68 and 21

30 do not use the same fractional units (they have 
different denominators). 

Mukta: Okay, so let us start making equivalent fractions then: 
   3

4  =  6
8  =  9

12   =  12
16   =  15

Sounds good!
  We have 3

4 and  7

(4 and 10) is 40.
  3

4 = 6
8 = 9

12 = 12
16 = 15

20  = 18
24 = … = 27

36 = 30
40 .

Go till we reach the 

  7 denominator 40.
10 = 14

20 = 21
30 = 28

40.

15 14
But notice that 20 and 20 also had Yes! We just needed to get the 
the same denominator! same fractional units for each

Shabnam:  So, fractions equivalent to 34 and 7
10 with the same fractional 

unit (same denominators) are  30
40  and  28

40, or 15
20 and 14

Expressing a fraction in lowest terms (or in its simplest 
form) 
In any fraction, if its numerator and denominator have no common 
factor except 1, then the fraction is said to be in lowest terms or in 
its simplest form. In other words, a fraction is said to be in lowest 
terms if its numerator and denominator are as small as possible.

 Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an
equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small 
as possible. 

Let’s see how to express fractions in lowest terms. 
Example: Is the fraction 16

20 in lowest terms? No, 4 is a common factor 
of 16 and 20. Let us reduce 16

20 to lowest terms. 
We know that both 16 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) are 

divisible by 4. 

So, 16 ÷ 4
20 ÷ 4  = 4

Now, there is no common factor between 4 and 5. Hence, 16

20 
expressed in lowest terms is 4

5. So, 4
5 is called the simplest form of 16

20 , 
since 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1.

Any fraction can be converted to 
lowest terms by dividing both the 

numerator and denominator by the 
highest common factor between 

them.

Fractions

Expressing a fraction in lowest terms can also be done in steps. 
Suppose we want to express 36

60  in lowest terms. First, we notice 
that both the numerator and denominator are even. So, we divide 
both by 2, and see that 36

60  =  18
30 .

Both the numerator and denominator are even again, so we can 
divide them each by 2 again; we get  18

30  = 9
15 . 

We now notice that 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, so we divide 
both by 3 to get  9

15  = 3
5 . 

Now, 3 and 5 have no common factor other than 1, so,  36
60  in lowest 

terms is 3.
5

Alternatively, we could have noticed that in 36
60  , both the numerator 

and denominator are multiples of 12 : we see that 36 = 3 × 12 and 
60 = 5 × 12. Therefore, we could have concluded that  36

60 = 35 straight away.
Either method works and will give the same answer! But 

sometimes it can be easier to go in steps.

45 

 7
9  =  7×5

8×5  = 35

use 45 as a common 

denominator.

63 is a common multiple of 9 and 21. We can then write:

9 = 7×7

9×7  =  49

21  = 17×3
21×3 = 51

Steps to compare the sizes of two or more given fractions:
Step 1:  Change the given fractions to equivalent fractions so that 

they all are expressed with the same denominator or same 
fractional unit.

the numerators, i.e., the number of fractional units each has.

3  = 1 × 4
3 × 4  = 4

This method of addition, which works for adding any number of 
fractions,wasfirstexplicitlydescribedingeneralbyBrahmagupta
in the year 628 CE! We will describe the history of the development 
of fractions in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we simply 
summarise the steps in Brahmagupta’s method for addition of 
fractions.
Brahmagupta’s method for adding fractions 
1. Find equivalent fractions so that the fractional unit is common 

forallfractions.Thiscanbedonebyfindingacommonmultiple
of the denominators (e.g., the product of the denominators, or the 
smallest common multiple of the denominators). 

2. Add these equivalent fractions with the same fractional units. 
This can be done by adding the numerators and keeping the same 
denominator. 

3. Express the result in lowest terms if needed.

Let us carry out another example of Brahmagupta’s method. 

Example: Find the sum of 23 and 1
5.

The denominators of the given fractions are 3 and 5. The lowest 
common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Then we see that
2
3 = 2 × 5

3 × 5  = 10
15 , 1

5 = 1 × 3
5 × 3  = 3

15 .

Therefore,  2

15  + 3

15  = 13

The smallest common multiple of 6 and 3 is 6.

3 × 2  = 2
6  

Therefore, 1
6  + 1

3  = 1
6  + 2

6  = 3
6 .

The fraction 3
6  can now be re-expressed in lowest terms, if 

desired. This can be done by dividing both the numerator and 
denominator by 3 (the biggest common factor of 3 and 6):
3
6  = 3 ÷ 3

6 ÷ 3  = 1
2 .

Therefore, 1
6  + 1

3  = 1

Fractional parts to 
be removed.

the same fractional units.

So, we are left with 2 shaded parts, i.e., 67 – 4

7.9 A Pinch of History
Do you know what a fraction was called in ancient India? It was 
called bhinna in Sanskrit, which means ‘broken’. It was also called 
bhaga or ansha meaning ‘part’ or ‘piece’. 

The way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In 
ancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript 
(from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 1

2, they 
wrote it as 1

2 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it 
today! This method of writing and working with fractions continued 
to be used in India for the next several centuries, including by 
Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya 
(c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others. The line 
segment between the numerator and denominator in ‘12’ and in other 

182

Chapter 7_Fractions.indd   182 13-08-2024   15:39:48



Fractions

fractions was later introduced by the Moroccan mathematician 
Al-Hassar (in the 12th century). Over the next few centuries the
notation then spread to Europe and around the world.

Fractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient 
Egyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only 
fractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More 
general fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now 
called ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional 
units, e.g., 19

24  = 1
2 + 1

6 + 1
8, can be quite an art and leads to beautiful 

puzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below. 
General fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1) 

werefirstintroducedinIndia,alongwiththeirrulesofarithmetic
operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even 
division of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulba-
sutras’ shows that even during  Vedic times, Indians had discovered 
the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures 
forworkingwithandcomputingwithfractionswerefirstcodified
formally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta. 

Brahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with 
fractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta 
described how to add and subtract fractions as follows:

“By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator 
of each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions 
are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition, 
the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added. 
In case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta, 
Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta,Verse12.2,628CE)

The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were 
transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and 
they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century 
and then spread worldwide.

 Puzzle!
  It is easy to add up fractional units to obtain the sum 1, if one 

uses the same fractional unit, for example, 

 1
2 + 1

2 = 1,  13 + 1
3 + 1

3 = 1,  14 + 1
4 + 1

4 + 1
4 = 1, etc. 

  However, can you think of a way to add fractional units that 
are all different to get 1?

  It is not possible to add two different fractional units to get 1. 
The reason is that 12 is the largest fractional unit, and 12 + 1

2 = 1. 
  To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at 

least one of the 1
2’s with some smaller fractional unit - but then 

the sum would be less than 1! Therefore, it is not possible for 
two different fractional units to add up to 1. 

  We can try to look instead for a way to write 1 as the sum of 
three different fractional units. 

	 1.	 	Can	you	find	three	different	fractional	units	 that	add	 Try
up to 1? This

    It turns out there is only one solution to this problem 
(up to changing the order of the 3 fractions)! Can you 
find	it?	Try	to	find	it	before	reading	further.	

Here	 is	 a	 systematic	 way	 to	 find	 the	 solution.	 We	 know	 that	 
1
3 + 1

3 + 1
3 = 1. To get the  fractional units to be different, we will have 

to increase at least one of the 1
3’s, and decrease at least one of the 

other 1
3’s to compensate for that increase.  The only way to increase 

1
3 to another fractional unit is to replace it by 1

2. So 1
2 must be one of 

the fractional units.
Now 1

2 + 1
4 + 1

4 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we 
will have to increase one of the 1

4’s and decrease the other 1
4 to 

compensate for that increase. Now the only way to increase 1
4 to 

184

Chapter 7_Fractions.indd   184 14-08-2024   15:06:07



Fractions

another fractional unit, that is different from 1
2, is to replace it by 1

3. 
So two of the fractions must be 12 and 13! What must be third fraction 
then, so that the three fractions add up to 1?

This explains why there is only one solution to the above problem. 

1
2 + 13 + 1

6  = 1

What if we look for four different fractional units that add up to 1?

	 2.	 	Can	you	find	four	different	 fractional	units	 that	add	
up to 1? Try

This
    It turns out that this problem has six solutions! Can 

you	find	at	least	one	of	them?	Can	you	find	them	all?	
You can try using similar reasoning as in the cases 
of	two	and	three	fractional	units	—	or	find	your	own	
method! 

Once	you	find	one	solution,	try	to	divide	a	circle	into	parts	
like	in	the	figure	above	to	visualise	it!

Now, arm yourself with a ruler and a compass. Let us explore if 
we can draw these figures with these tools and get familiar with a 
compass.

Observe the way a compass is made. What can one draw with the 
compass? Explore!

Do you know what curves are? They are any shapes that can be 
drawn on paper with a pencil, and include straight lines, circles and 
other figures as shown below:

Mark a point ‘P’ in your notebook. Then, mark as many points as 
possible, in different directions, that are 4 cm away from P. 

 Think: Imagine marking all the points of 4 cm distance from the 
point P. How would they look? 
 Try to draw it and verify if it is correct by taking some points on 
the curve and checking if their distances from P are indeed 4 cm.

Explore, if you have not already done so, 
R

and see if a compass can be used for this 
purpose.

You can start by marking a few points 
of distance 4 cm from P using the compass. 
How can this be done? P 4 cm Q

Playing with Constructions

You will have to open up the compass against a ruler (see Fig. 8.2) 
such that the distance between the tip of the compass and the pencil 
is 4 cm. 

  Now, try to get the full curve. 

Hint: Keep the point of the compass fixed moving only the pencil.
What is the shape of the curve? It is a circle!

Take a point on the circle. What will be its distance from P—equal 
to 4 cm, less than 4 cm or greater than 4 cm? Similarly, what will be 
the distance between P and another point on the circle?

As shown in the figure, the point P is called the centre of the circle 
and the distance between the centre and any point on the circle is 
called the radius of the circle.

Can you make the figures look as good as the figures shown there? 
Try again if you want to!

Also, has the use of instruments made the construction easier?
Now try constructing the following figures.

 This figure has two components.

 You might have figured out a way of drawing the first part. For 
drawing the second part, see this.

 The challenge here is to find out where to place the tip of the 
compass and the radius to be taken for drawing this curve. You 
can fix a radius in the compass and try placing the tip of the

getting the curve. Use your estimate where to keep the tip.

2. Wavy Wave
 Construct this.

 As the length of the central line is not specified, we can take it to 
be of any length.

  Let us take AB to be the central line such that the length of AB  is 
8 cm. We write this as AB = 8 cm.

on it.

8.2 Squares and Rectangles
Now, let us look at some basic figures having straight lines in their 
boundary.

Fig. 8.3

What shapes are these? Yes, these are our familiar squares and 
rectangles. But what makes them squares and rectangles?

Consider this rectangle ABCD.
The points A, B, C and D are the corners A B

of the rectangle. Lines AB, BC, CD and DA 
are its sides. Its angles are ∠A, ∠B, ∠C 
and ∠D.

The blue sides AB and CD are called 
opposite sides, as they lie opposite to D Fig. 8.4 C

each other. Likewise, AD and BC is the 
other pair of opposite sides.

192

Chapter 8_Playing with Constructions.indd   192 13-08-2024   16:38:45



Playing with Constructions

Recall that, in a rectangle:
R1) The opposite sides are equal in length, and
R2) All the angles are 90°.
As in the case of rectangles, the corners and sides are defined for 

a square in the same manner.
A square satisfies the following two properties:
S1) All the sides are equal, and
S2) All the angles are 90o.
See the rectangle in Fig. 8.4 and the name given to it: ABCD. This 

rectangle can also be named in other ways — BCDA, CDAB, DABC, 
ADCB, DCBA, CBAD and BADC. So, can a rectangle be named using 
any combination of the labels around its corners? No! For example, 
it cannot be named ABDC or ACBD. Can you see what names are 
allowed and what names are not?

In a valid name, the corners occur in an order of travel around 
the rectangle, starting from any corner.

 Which of the following is not a name for this square? 
 1. PQSR S P

 2. SPQR
 3. RSPQ
 4. QRSP R Q

Rotated Squares and Rectangles
Here is a square piece of paper 
having all its sides equal in length 
and all angles equal to 90°. It is 
rotated as shown in the figure. Is it 
still a square?

Let us check if the rotated paper 
still satisfies the properties of a square.

• Are all the sides still equal? Yes.
• Are all the angles still 90°? Yes.

193

Chapter 8_Playing with Constructions.indd   193 13-08-2024   16:39:01



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Rotating a square does not change its 
lengths and angles.

Therefore, this rotated figure satisfies both 
the properties of a square and so, it is a square.

By the same reasoning, a rotated rectangle 
is still a rectangle.

 Figure it Out
1. Draw the rectangle and four squares configuration (shown in 

Fig. 8.3) on a dot paper.
 What did you do to recreate this figure so that the four squares 

are placed symmetrically around the rectangle? Discuss with 
your classmates.

2. Identify if there are any squares in this collection. 
Use measurements if needed.

A B C D

   Think: Is it possible to reason out if the sides are equal or 
not, and if the angles are right or not without using any 
measuring instruments in the above figure? Can we do this 
by only looking at the position of corners in the dot grid?

3. Draw at least 3 rotated squares and rectangles on a dot grid. Draw 
them such that their corners are on the dots. Verify if the squares 
and rectangles that you have drawn satisfy their respective 
properties.

 At which positions will the points X and Y be at their closest? 
When do you think they will be the farthest? What does your Math 

Talk
intuition say? Discuss with your classmates.

Now, verify your guesses by placing the points X and Y on the 
sides and measure how near or far they are.

The distance between X and Y can be obtained by measuring the 
length of the line XY.

How does the minimum distance between the points X and Y 
compare to the length of AB?

Change the positions of X and Y to check if there are other 
positions where they are at their nearest or farthest. You could 
construct multiple copies of the rectangle and try out various 
positions of X and Y.

How will you keep track of the lengths XY for different positions 
of X and Y?

Here is one way of doing it. Suppose here are some of the positions 
of X and Y that you have considered:

• When X is 5 mm away from A and Y is 3 cm away from B,  
XY = ___ cm __ mm

• When X is 1 cm away from A and Y is 1 cm away from B,  
XY = ___ cm ___ mm

• When X is 2 cm away from A and Y is 4 cm away from B,  
XY = ___ cm ___ mm and so on.

 Is there a shorthand way of writing it down? In all the sentences, 
only the position of X, Y and the length XY changes. So we could 
write this as:

Distance of X from A Distance of Y from B LengthofXY

198

Chapter 8_Playing with Constructions.indd   198 13-08-2024   16:39:02



Playing with Constructions

 Have you checked what happens to the length XY when X and Y 
are placed at the same distance away from A and B, respectively? 
For example, as in the cases like these:

Distance of X Distance of Y Length of XY
from A from B
5 mm 5 mm

1 cm 1 cm

1 cm 5 mm 1 cm 5 mm

and so on.

 In each of these cases, observe 
 1. how the length XY compares to that of AB and 
	 2.	 the	shape	of	the	4-sided	figure	ABYX.

 How does the farthest distance between X and Y compare with 
the length of AC? BD?

 O ne way is to visualise the final figure by drawing a rough 
diagram of it.

A B C

F E D

 What can we infer from this figure?
 Can you identify the equal sides?
 Since, the two squares are identical, 
 AB = BC and FE = ED
 S ince ABEF and BCDE are squares, all the sides in each of the 

squares are equal. This is written as —
 AF = AB = BE = FE
 BE = BC = CD = ED
 So, all the shorter lines are equal!
 A  convention is followed to represent equal sides. It is done by 

putting a ‘|’ on the line. Refer to the rough figure.
 U sing this analysis, can you try constructing it? Remember, all 

that was asked for is a rectangle that can be divided into two 
identical squares and with no measurements imposed.

 T o draw the rectangle ACDF, one could assign any length to AF. For 
example, if we assign AF = 4 cm, then what must the length of AC be?

  Explore: Can the rectangle now be completed?

  In fact, one could proceed by drawing AF without even 
measuring its length using a ruler. We could then construct a 
line perpendicular to AF that is long enough to contain the other 
side. As, AB = AF, we need to somehow transfer the length of AF

done using a compass?

 Observe, how the length of AF is measured using a compass.

In rectangle PQRS, the right angles at P and R are referred to as 
opposite angles. The other pair of opposite angles are the right 
angles at Q and S.

Observe that a diagonal divides each of the pair of opposite 
angles into two smaller angles. In the figure, the diagonal PR divides 
angle R into two smaller angles which we simply call g and h. The 
diagonal also divides angle P into c and d. Are g and h equal? Are 
c and d equal?

First predict the answers, and then measure the angles. What do 
you observe? Identify pairs of angles that are equal.

 Explore
How should the rectangle be constructed so that the diagonal divides 
the opposite angles into equal parts?

How will you record your observations? First, identify the 
parameters that need to be tracked. They are the sides of the rectangle 
and the 8 angles formed by the two diagonals. Are there any other 
measurements that you would want to keep track of?

  One of the ways of marking B is by taking a ruler and trying 
to move it around to get a point on line l that is 7 cm from point D. 
However, this requires trial and error. There is another efficient 
method which doesn’t involve trial and error.

  For this, instead of trying to get that one required point of distance 
7 cm from D, let us explore a way of getting all the points of 
distance 7 cm from D.

What is its distance from point D? If needed, check your figure. 
What do you observe?

  The point where the circle intersects the line l is the required 
point B.

  We need to locate the point A that is of distance 5 cm from

construction can be further simplified. How?

  If you have guessed that this can be done by the use of

The flower looks the same from many different angles. What 

about the butterfly? No doubt, the colours are very attractive. But 
what else about the butterfly appeals to you?

In these pictures, it appears that some parts of the figure are 
repeated and these repetitions seem to occur in a definite pattern. 
Can you see what repeats in the beautiful rangoli figure? In the

rangoli, the red petals come back onto themselves when the flower 
is rotated by 90˚ around the centre and so do the other parts of the 
rangoli.

What about the pinwheel? Can you spot which pattern is repeating? 
Hint:  Look at the hexagon first.

Now, can you say what figure repeats 
along each side of the hexagon? What 
is the shape of the figure that is stuck to 
each side? Do you recognise it? How do 
these shapes move as you move along the 
boundary of the hexagon? What about 
the other pictures — what is it about 
those structures that appeals to you and 
what are the patterns in those structures 
that repeat? Clouds

On the other hand, look at this picture 
of clouds. There is no such repetitive pattern.

We can say that the first four figures are symmetrical and the last one is 
not symmetrical. A symmetry refers to a part or parts of a figure that 
are repeated in some definite pattern.

Symmetry

9.1 Line of Symmetry
Figure (a) shows the picture of a blue triangle with a dotted line. 
What if you fold the triangle along the dotted line? Yes, one half 
of the triangle covers the other half completely. These are called 
mirror halves! 

(a) (b)

What about Figure (b) with the four puzzle pieces and a dotted line 
passing through the middle? Are they mirror halves? No, when we fold 
along the line, the left half does not exactly fit over the right half.

A line that cuts a figure into two  parts that exactly overlap when 
folded along that line is called a line of symmetry of the figure.

 Figure it Out 
1. Do you see any line of symmetry in the figures at the start of the 

chapter? What about in the picture of the cloud?
2. For each of the following figures, identify the line(s) of symmetry 

if it exists.

Figures with more than one line of symmetry
Does a square have only one line of symmetry?
Take a square piece of paper. By folding, find all its lines of symmetry. 

Fold 1

Fold 2

Fold 3

Fold 4

Here are the different folds giving different lines of symmetry.
• Fold the paper into half vertically.
• Fold it again into half horizontally (i.e., you have folded it 

twice). Now open out the folds.
Vertical Fold

Horizontal Fold

Again fold the square into half (for a third time now), but this 
time along a diagonal, as shown in the figure. Again, open it.

220

Chapter 9_Symmetry.indd   220 13-08-2024   17:05:25



Symmetry

Fold it into half (for the fourth time), but this time along the other 
diagonal, as shown in the figure. Open out the fold.

 Is there any other way to fold the square so that the two halves 
overlap? How many lines of symmetry does the square shape have?
 Thus, figures can have multiple lines of symmetry. The figures 
below also have multiple lines of symmetry. Can you find them all?

 We saw that the diagonal of a square is also a line of symmetry. 
Let us take a rectangle that is not a square. Is its diagonal a line of 
symmetry?

 First, see the rectangle and answer this 
question. Then, take a rectangular piece of 
paper and check if the two parts overlap by 
folding it along its diagonal. What do you 
observe?

Reflection
So far we have been saying that when we fold a figure along a line of 
symmetry, the two parts overlap completely. We could also say that 
the part of the figure on one side of the line of symmetry is reflected 
by the line to the other side; similarly, the part of the figure on the 
other side of the line of symmetry is reflected to the first side! Let us 
understand this by labeling some points on the figure.

The figure shows a square with its corners labeled A, B, C and D. 
Let us first consider the vertical line of symmetry. When we reflect 

221

Chapter 9_Symmetry.indd   221 13-08-2024   17:05:25



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

the square along this line, the points B, C on the right get reflected to 
the left side and occupy the positions occupied earlier by A, D. What 
happens to the points A, D? A occupies the position occupied by B and 
D that of C!

A B

D C

 What if we reflect along the diagonal from A to C? Where do 
points A, B, C and D go? What if we reflect along the horizontal line of 
symmetry?
A figure that has a line or lines of symmetry is thus, also said to have 
reflection symmetry.

Generating shapes having lines of symmetry
So far we have seen symmetrical figures and asymmetrical 
figures. How does one generate such symmetrical figures? Let us 
explore this.
Ink Blot Devils
You enjoyed doing this earlier in Class 5. Take a piece of paper. Fold 
it in half. Open the paper and spill a few drops of ink (or paint) on 
one half.

Now press the halves together and then open the paper again.
• What do you see?
• Is the resulting figure symmetric?
• If yes, where is the line of symmetry?
• Is there any other line along which it can be folded to produce 

two identical parts?
• Try making more such patterns.

Paper Folding and Cutting 
Here is another way of making symmetric shapes!

In these two figures, a sheet of paper is 
folded and a cut is made along the dotted 
line shown. Draw a sketch of how the paper 
will look when unfolded.

Do you see a line of symmetry in this 
figure? What is it?

Make different symmetric shapes by folding and cutting.
There are more ways of folding and cutting pieces of paper to get 

symmetric shapes!
Use thin rectangular coloured 

paper. Fold it several times and 
create some intricate patterns by 
cutting the paper, like the one shown 
here. Identify the lines of symmetry 
in the repeating design. Use such 
decorative paper cut-outs for festive 
occasions.

 Punching Game
  The fold is a line of symmetry. Punch holes at different locations of 

a folded square sheet of paper using a punching machine and create 
different symmetric patterns.

13.  Copy the following on a dot grid. For each figure draw two more 
lines to make a shape that has a line of symmetry.

9.2 Rotational Symmetry
The paper windmill in the picture looks 
symmetrical but there is no line of symmetry! 
However, if you fold it, the two halves will not 
exactly overlap. On the other hand, if you rotate 
it by 90° about the red point at the centre, the 
windmill looks exactly the same.

We say that the windmill has rotational 
symmetry.

When talking of rotational symmetry, there is always a fixed 
point about which the object is rotated. This fixed point is called the 180˚
centre of rotation.

Will the windmill above look exactly the same when rotated 
through an angle of less than 90°?

No!
An angle through which a figure can be rotated to look exactly the 180˚

same is called an angle of rotational symmetry, or just an angle of 
symmetry, for short.

230

Chapter 9_Symmetry.indd   230 13-08-2024   17:05:28



Symmetry

For the windmill, the angles of symmetry are 90° (quarter turn), 
180° (half turn), 270° (three-quarter turn) and 360° (full turn). 
Observe that when any figure is rotated by 360°, it comes back to its 
original position, so 360° is always an angle of symmetry.

Thus, we see that the windmill has 4 angles of symmetry.
Do you know of any other shape that has exactly four angles of 

symmetry?
How many angles of symmetry does a square have? How much 

rotation does it require to get the initial square?
We get back a square overlapping with itself after 90° of rotation. 

This takes point A to the position of point B, point B to the position 
of point C, point C to the position of point D, and point D back to the 
position of point A. Do you know where to mark the centre of rotation?

Example: Find the angles of symmetry of the following strip.

Solution: Let us rotate the strip in a clockwise direction about its centre.

A rotation of 180° results in the figure above. Does this overlap 
with the original figure.

No. Why?
Another rotation through 180° from this position gives the original 

shape.
This figure comes back to its original shape only after one 

complete rotation through 360°. So, we say that this figure does not 
have rotational symmetry.

Rotational Symmetry of Figures with 
Radial Arms
Consider this figure, a picture with 90O

4 radial arms. How many angles of 
symmetry does it have? What are they? 
Note that the angle between adjacent 
central dotted lines is 90°.

Can you change the angles between 
the radial arms so that the figure still has 
4 angles of symmetry? Try drawing it.

To check if the figure drawn indeed has 4 angles of symmetry, 
you could draw the figure on two different pieces of paper. Cut out 
the radial arms from one of the papers. Keep the figure on the paper 
fixed and rotate the cutout to check for rotational symmetry.

How will you modify the figure above so that it has only two 
angles of symmetry?

232

Chapter 9_Symmetry.indd   232 13-08-2024   17:05:28



Symmetry

Here is one way:

We have seen figures having 4 and 2 angles of symmetry. Can we 
get a figure having exactly 3 angles of symmetry? Can you use radial 
arms for this?

Let us try with 3 radial arms as in the figure below. How many 
angles of symmetry does it have and what are they?

Here is a figure with three radial arms.

Trace and cut out a copy of this figure. By rotating the cutout over 
this figure determine its angles of rotation.

We see that only a full turn or a rotation of 360° will bring the figure 
back into itself. So this figure does not have rotational symmetry as 
360 degrees is its only angle of symmetry.

However, can anything in the figure be changed to make it have 
3 angles of symmetry?

233

Chapter 9_Symmetry.indd   233 13-08-2024   17:05:29



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Can it be done by changing the angles between the dotted lines?
If a figure with three radial arms should have rotational symmetry, 

then a rotated version of it should overlap with the original. Here 
are rough diagrams of both of them.

If these two figures must overlap, what can you tell about the 
angles?

C A B C

B A

Observe that ∠A must overlap ∠B, ∠B must overlap ∠C and ∠C 
must overlap ∠A.

So, ∠A = ∠B = ∠C. What must this angle be?
We know that a full turn has 360 degrees. This is equally distributed 

amongst these three angles. So each angle must be 360°
3  = 120°.

So, the radial arms figure with 3 arms shows rotational symmetry 
when the angle between the adjacent dotted lines is 120°. Use paper 
cutouts to verify this observation.

Now how many angles of rotation does the figure have and what 
are they?

Initial After 120° After 240° After 360° 
position rotation (120° + 120°) (120° + 120°+ 120°) 

rotation rotation
Note: The colours have been added to show the rotations.

Symmetry

Let us explore more figures.
 Can you draw a figure with radial arms that has a) exactly 5 

angles of symmetry, b) 6 angles of symmetry? Also find the angles of 
symmetry in each case.
Hint:  Use 5 radial arms for the first case. What should the angle 

between two adjacent radial arms be?
 Consider a figure with radial arms having exactly 7 angles 

of symmetry. What will be its smallest angle of symmetry? Is the 
number of degrees a whole number in this case? If not, express it as 
a mixed fraction.
Let us find the angles of symmetry for other kinds of figures.

 Figure it Out 
1. Find the angles of symmetry for the given figures about the point 

marked •.

(a) (b) (c)

2. Which of the following figures have more than one angle of 
symmetry?

235

Chapter 9_Symmetry.indd   235 13-08-2024   17:05:29



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

3. Give the order of rotational symmetry for each figure:

Let us list down the angles of symmetry for all the cases above.
• Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 2 of them: 180°, 360°.
• Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 3 of them: 120°, 

240°, 360°.
• Angles of symmetry when there are exactly 4 of them: 90°, 

180°, 270°, 360°.
Do you observe something common about the angles of symmetries 

in these cases? The first set of numbers are all multiples of 180. The 
second are all multiples of 120. The third are all multiples of 90. 

 In each case, the angles are the multiples of the smallest angle. 
You may wonder and ask if this will always happen. What do you 
think?

 True or False
• Every figure will have 360 degrees as an angle of symmetry.

236

Chapter 9_Symmetry.indd   236 13-08-2024   17:05:30



Symmetry

• If the smallest angle of symmetry of a figure is a natural number 
in degrees, then it is a factor of 360.

Is there a smallest angle of symmetry for all figures? It turns out 
that this is the case for most figures, except for the most symmetric 
shapes like the circle, whose symmetries we now discuss.

Symmetries of a circle
The circle is a fascinating figure. What happens when you rotate a 
circle clockwise about its centre? It coincides with itself. It does not 
matter what angle you rotate it by! So, for a circle, every angle is an 
angle of symmetry.

Now take a point on the rim of the circle and join it to the centre. 
Extend the segment to a diameter of the circle. Is that diameter 
a line of reflection symmetry? It is. Every diameter is a line of 
symmetry!
Like wheels, we can find other objects around us having rotational 
symmetry. Find them. Some of them are shown below:

adjacent squares by drawing Not allowed
a line. The line can be placed

not able to place a line loses.

With what strategy can one play to win this game?

Summary
 When a figure is made up of parts that repeat in a definite pattern, 

we say that the figure has symmetry. We say that such a figure is 
symmetrical.

 A line that cuts a plane figure into two parts that exactly overlap 
when folded along that line is called a line of symmetry or axis of 
symmetry of the figure.

 A figure may have multiple lines of symmetry.
 Sometimes a figure looks exactly the same when it is rotated by an 

angle about a fixed point. Such an angle is called an angle of symmetry 
of the figure. A figure that has an angle of symmetry strictly between 
0 and 360 degrees is said to have rotational symmetry. The point 
of the figure about which the rotation occurs is called the centre of 
rotation.

 A figure may have multiple angles of symmetry.
 Some figures may have a line of symmetry but no angle of symmetry, 

while others may have angles of symmetry but no lines of symmetry. Some 
figures may have both lines of symmetry as well as angles of symmetry.

10 THE OTHER SIDE OF 
ZERO
Integers

More and More numbers!
Recall that the very first numbers we learned about in the study of 
mathematics were the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, …  

Then we learned that there are even more numbers! For example, 
there is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before 
1.  The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the 
world. For example, around the world we learn to write numbers in 
the Indian number system using the digits 0 to 9, allowing us to write 
numbers however large or however small using just these 10 digits. 

We then learned about more numbers that exist between the 
numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … , such as 1 , 3 , and 13 . These are called 

2 2 6
fractions.

But are there still more numbers? Well, 0 is an additional number 
that we didn’t know about earlier, and it comes before 1 and is less 
than 1. Are there perhaps more numbers that come before 0 and are 
less than 0?

Phrased another way, we have seen the number line:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

However, this is actually only a number ‘ray’, in the language we 
learned earlier in geometry; this ray starts at 0 and goes forever to 
the right. Do there exist numbers to the left of 0, so that this number 
ray can be completed to a true number line?

That is what we will investigate in this chapter!

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   242 13-08-2024   17:32:05



The Other Side of Zero

 Can there be a number less than 0? Can you think of any ways to 
have less than 0 of something?

10.1 Bela’s Building of Fun
Children flock to Bela’s ice cream factory to see 
and taste her tasty ice cream. To make it even 
more fun for them, Bela purchased a multi-
storied building and filled it with attractions. 
She named it Bela’s Building of Fun. 

But this was no ordinary building! 
Observe that some of the floors in the 

‘Building of Fun’ are below the ground. What are the shops that you 
find on these floors? What is there on the ground floor?

A lift is used to go up and down between the floors. It has two 
buttons: ‘+’ to go up and ‘–’ to go down. Can you spot the lift?

To go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you 
must press the ‘+’ button twice. 

We say that the button press is + + or + 2.
To go down two floors, you must press the ‘–’ 

button twice, which we write as – – or – 2.
So if you press + 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘+’ 

button once), then you will go up one floor and if 
you press – 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘–’ button 
once), then you will go down 1 floor.

Lift button presses and numbers:
+++ is written as + 3
 – – – – is written as –  4

 What do you press to go four floors up? 
What do you press to go three floors down?

Numbering the floors in the building of fun
Entry to the ‘Building of Fun’ is at the ground floor level and is called 
the ‘Welcome Hall’. Starting from the ground floor, you can reach the 
Food Court by pressing + 1 and can reach the Art Centre by pressing 
+ 2. So, we can say that the Food Court is on Floor + 1 and that the Art 
Centre is on Floor + 2.

Starting from the ground floor, you must press – 1 to reach the Toy 
Store. So, the Toy Store is on Floor – 1 similarly starting from the ground 
floor, you must press – 2 to reach the Video Games shop. So, the Video 
Games shop is on Floor – 2.

The ground floor is called Floor 0. Can you see why?
 Number all the floors in the Building of Fun.

Did you notice that + 3 is the floor number of the Book 
Store, but it is also the number of floors you move 
when you press + 3? Similarly,  – 3 is the floor number 
but it is also the number of floors you go down when 
you press – 3, i.e., when you press – – – .

A number with a ‘+’ sign in front is called a positive 
number. A number with a ‘–’ sign in front is called a 
negative number. 

In the ‘Building of Fun’, the floors are numbered 
using the ground floor, Floor 0, as a reference or starting 
point. The floors above the ground floor are numbered 
with positive numbers. To get to them from the ground 
floor, one must press the ‘+’ button some number of 
times. The floors below the ground are numbered with 
negative numbers. To get to them from the ground floor, 
one must press the ‘–’ button some number of times.

Zero is neither a positive nor a negative number. 
We do not put a ‘+’ or ‘–’ sign in front of it.

Addition to keep track of movement
Start from the Food Court and press + 2 in the lift. Where will you 
reach? ____________

We can describe this using an expression:
Starting Floor + Movement = Target Floor.
The starting floor is + 1 (Food Court) and the number of button 

presses is + 2. Therefore,  you reach the target floor (+ 1) + (+ 2) = + 3 
(Book Store).

 Figure it Out
1.  You start from Floor + 2 and press – 3 in the lift. Where will you 

reach? Write an expression for this movement.
2. Evaluate these expressions (you may think of them as Starting 

Floor + Movement by referring to the Building of Fun).
a. (+ 1) + (+ 4) = _______ b. (+ 4) + (+ 1) = _______
c. (+ 4) + (–  3) = _______ d. (– 1) + (+ 2) = _______
e. (– 1) + (+ 1) = _______ f.      0 + (+ 2) = _________
g.      0 + (– 2) = _________

3.  Starting from different floors, find the movements required to 
reach Floor – 5. For example, if I start at Floor + 2, I must press – 7 
to reach Floor – 5. The expression is (+ 2) + (– 7) = – 5.

  Find more such starting positions and the movements needed to 
reach Floor – 5 and write the expressions.

Combining button presses is also addition 
Gurmit was in the Toy Store and wanted to go down two floors. 
But by mistake he pressed the ‘+’ button two times. He realised his 
mistake and quickly pressed the ‘–’ button three times. How many 
floors below or above the Toy Store will Gurmit reach?

Gurmit will go one floor down. We can show the movement 
resulting from combining button presses as an expression: 
(+ 2) + (– 3) = – 1.

Evaluate these expressions by thinking of them as the resulting movement 
of combining button presses:

Back to zero!
On the ground floor, Basant is in a great hurry and by 
mistake he presses +3. What can he do to cancel it and 
stay on the ground floor? He can cancel it by pressing 
– 3. That is, (+3) + (– 3) = 0.

We call – 3 the inverse of +3. Similarly, the inverse of 
– 3 is +3.

If Basant now presses +4 and then presses – 4 in the 
lift, where will he reach?

Here is another way to think of the concept of 
inverse. If you are at Floor +4 and you press its inverse 
– 4, then you are back to zero, the ground floor! If you 
are at Floor – 2 and press its inverse +2, then you go to 
(– 2) + (+2) = 0, again the ground floor!

  Write the inverses of these numbers:     
+4, –4, –3, 0, +2, –1.

  Connect the inverses by drawing lines.
+5 –7 –8 +9

–9 +8 –5 +7

Comparing numbers using floors
 Who is on the lowest floor? 

1. Jay is in the Art Centre. So, he is on Floor +2. 
2. Asin is in the Sports Centre. So, she is on Floor ___.
3. Binnu is in the Cinema Centre. So, she is on Floor ____. 
4. Aman is in the Toys Store. So, he is on Floor ____.

Floor +3 is lower than Floor +4. So, we write +3 < +4. We 
also write +4 > +3. 

 Should we write –3 < – 4 or – 4 < – 3? H
Floor – 4 is lower than Floor – 3. So, – 4 < – 3. It is also 

correct to write – 3 > – 4

1.  Compare the following numbers using the Building of 
Fun and fill in the boxes with < or >. G

Notice that all negative number floors are below E
Floor 0. So, all negative numbers are less than 0. All +1
the positive number floors are above Floor 0. So, all 0
positive numbers are greater than 0. D –1

the numbers and fill in the boxes with < or >:

of Floors B, C, F, G, and H.

4. Mark the following floors of the building shown on 
the right. A –12
a. – 7 b. –  4 c. + 3 d. –  10

Subtraction to find which button to press
In earlier classes, we understood the meaning of subtraction as ‘take 
away’. For example, there are 10 books on the shelf. I take away 4 
books. How many are left on the shelf?

We can express the answer using subtraction: 10 – 4 = 6 or ‘Ten 
take away four is six.’

247

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   247 13-08-2024   17:32:08



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

You may also be familiar with another meaning of subtraction which 
is related to comparison or making quantities equal. For example, 
consider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6.

Now, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my 
sister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ

We can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10   Or   10 – 6 = ?
Here, we see the connection between ‘finding the missing number 

to be added’ and subtraction.
For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use 

this meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing 
number to be added’.

  Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective. 

Teacher’s note
In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can 
indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction 
shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to 
become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels, 
what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting 
Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) 
or negative (for a decrease).

Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the 
Sports Centre. What should be your button press?

You need to go three floors up, so you should press + 3. We can 
write this as an expression using subtraction: 

Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed.
In the above example, the starting floor is + 2 (Art Centre) and 
the target floor is + 5. The button press to get to + 5 from + 2 is + 3. 
Therefore, 

(+ 5) – (+ 2) = + 3

Explanation 
Recall the connection between addition and subtraction. For 3 + ? = 5, 

we can find the missing number using subtraction: 5 – 3 = 2. That is, 
subtraction is the same as finding the missing number to be added. 

We know that —
Starting Floor + Movement needed = Target Floor

If the movement needed is to be found, then,
Starting Floor + ? = Target Floor

So, 
Target Floor – Starting Floor = ? = Movement needed

More examples:
a. If the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting Floor is – 2, what button 

should you press?  
 You need to go one floor up, so, you should press + 1. 
 Expression:  (– 1) – (– 2) = (+1)
b. If the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting floor is +3, what button 

should you press?  
 You need to go four floors down, so, you should press – 4. 
 Expression:  (– 1) – (+ 3) = (– 4)
c. If the Target Floor is +2 and Starting Floor is – 2,  what button 

should you press?  
 You need to go four floors up, so, you should press +4. 
 Expression:  (+ 2) – (– 2) = (+ 4)

  Figure it Out
  Complete these expressions. You may think of them as finding the 

movement needed to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor.

Adding and subtracting larger numbers 
+1000

The picture shows a mine, a place where 
minerals are extracted by digging into the 
rock. The truck is at the ground level, but 
the minerals are present both above and 
below the ground level. There is a fast 
moving lift which moves up and down in 

+600
a mineshaft carrying people and ore. 

Some of the levels are marked in the 
picture. The ground level is marked 0. 
Levels above the ground are marked by 
positive numbers and levels below the 
ground are marked by negative numbers. 
The number indicates how many metres 
above or below the ground level it is.

In the mine, just like in the Building of Fun:
Starting Level + Movement = Target Level
For example,
(+ 40) + (+ 60) = + 100  (– 90) + (– 55) = – 145
Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed
For example,
(+ 40) – (– 50) = + 90   (– 90) – (+ 40) = – 130

How many negative numbers are there?
Bela’s Building of Fun had only six floors above and five floors below. 
That is numbers – 5 to + 6. In the mine above, we have numbers from 
– 200 to + 180. But we can imagine larger buildings or mineshafts. 
Just as positive numbers + 1, + 2, + 3, ... keep going up without an end, 
similarly, negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, ... keep going down. Positive 
and negative numbers, with zero, are called integers. They go both 
ways from 0: … – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … – 1000

lifts! In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards 
+300 and forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even 
+200 have to be any building or mine around — just an ‘infinite lift’! 

+100 We can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like.
For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000

– (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground 

– 100 and 200 below the ground. Recall that,
– 200 Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed
– 300 To go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we 

must press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after 
– 400 that to get to + 2200). Therefore, (+ 2000) – (– 200) = + 2200.  
– 500 Notice that (+ 2000) + (+ 200) is also + 2200.

In the above example, we saw that + 2000 – (– 200) = + 2000 + (+ 200) 
= + 2200. In other words, subtracting a negative number is the same 
as adding the corresponding positive number. That is, we can 
replace subtraction of a negative number by addition of a positive 
number!

 In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice 
that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding 
the corresponding positive number? Math 

Talk
Take a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you 

of a number line?  In what ways?

Back to the number line
The ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line, 
didn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number 
line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line, 
answering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the 
chapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, … 

Usually we drop the ‘+’ sign on positive numbers and simply write 
them as 1, 2, 3, … 

– 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Instead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can 
simply imagine walking on it. To the right is the positive (forward) 
direction, and to the left is the negative (backward) direction. 

Smaller numbers are now to the left of bigger numbers and 
bigger numbers are to the right of smaller numbers. So, 2 < 5; 
– 3 < 2; and – 5 < – 3. 

 If, from 5 you wish to go over to 9, how far must you travel along 
the number line?

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

252

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   252 13-08-2024   17:32:09



The Other Side of Zero

You must travel 4 steps. That is why 5 + 4 = 9. 
(Remember: Starting number + Movement = Target number)
The corresponding subtraction statement is 9 – 5 = 4. 
(Remember:  Target number – Starting number = Movement 

needed)

 Now, from 9, if you wish to go to 3, how much must you travel 
along the number line? 

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

You must move 6 steps backward, i.e., you must move –6. Hence, 
we write 9 + (–6) = 3.  

(Remember again : S tarting number + Movement = Target 
number) 

The corresponding subtraction statement is 3 – 9 = – 6.  
(Remember again:  T arget number – Starting number = Movement 

needed)

 Now, from 3, if you wish to go to – 2, how far must you travel?

– 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

You must travel – 5 steps, i.e., 5 steps backward. Thus, 3 + (– 5) = – 2. 
The corresponding subtraction statement is: – 2 – 3 = – 5. 

 Figure it Out

– 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

line above. 

2. Write down the above 3 marked negative numbers in the following 
boxes:

Using the unmarked number line to add and subtract
Just as you can do additions, subtractions and comparisons with small 
numbers using the number line above, you can also do them with 
large numbers by imagining an ‘infinite number line’ or drawing an 
‘unmarked number line’ as follows:

0

This line shows only the position of zero. Other numbers are not 
marked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to 
add and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale 
of the number line and the positions of numbers on it.

For example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the 
addition problem: 85 + (– 60) = ? 

– 60

  
0 +25 +85

We then can visualise that 85 + (– 60) = 25
The following UNL shows a subtraction problem which can also be 

written as a missing addend problem: (– 100) – (+ 250) = ? or 250 + ? = – 100. 
?

– 100 0 + 250

We can then visualise that ? = –350 in this problem.
In this way, you can carry out addition and subtraction problems, 

with positive and negative numbers, on paper or in your head using an 
unmarked number line.

Converting subtraction to addition and addition to subtraction
Recall that Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed 

or
Target Floor = Starting Floor + Movement needed

If we start at 2 and wish to go to – 3, what is the movement needed? 
First method: Looking at the number line, we see we need to 

move – 5 (i.e., 5 in the backward direction). Therefore, – 3 – 2 = – 5. 
The movement needed is –5.

Second method: Break the journey from 2 to –3 into two parts. 
a. From 2 to 0, the movement is 0 – 2 = – 2. 
b. From 0 to –3, the movement is – 3 – 0 = – 3.

The total movement is the sum of the two movements: – 3 + (– 2) = – 5.
Look at the two coloured expressions. There is no subtraction in 

the second one!
In this way, we can always convert subtraction to addition. The 

number that is being subtracted can be replaced by its inverse 
and then added instead.

Similarly, a number that is being added can be replaced by 
its inverse and then subtracted.  In this way, we can also always 
convert addition to subtraction.

Examples: 
a. (+ 7) – (+ 5) = (+ 7) + (– 5)
b. (– 3) – (+ 8) = (– 3) + (– 8)
c. (+ 8) – (– 2) = (+ 8) + (+ 2)
d. (+ 6) – (– 9) = (+ 6) + (+ 9)

10.2 The Token Model
Using tokens for addition
In Bela’s Building of Fun, the lift attendant is bored. To entertain 
himself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative 
(black) tokens. Each time he presses the ‘+’ button, he takes a 
positive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly, 
each time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and 
puts it in his pocket. 

He starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After 
one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative 
tokens. On which floor is he now? 

He must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2. 
So, he is at Floor + 2 now. 

Here is another way to do the calculation.

A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because 
the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in 
his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively, 
and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative 
token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are 
left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2. 

We can perform any such addition using tokens! 

Example: Add + 5 and – 8. 

256

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   256 13-08-2024   17:32:15



The Other Side of Zero

From the picture, we see that we can remove five zero pairs, and we 
are then left with – 3. Therefore (+ 5) + (– 8) = – 3.

 Figure it Out
1. Complete the additions using tokens.
 a. (+ 6) + (+ 4) b. (– 3) + (– 2) 
 c. (+ 5) + (– 7) d. (– 2) + (+ 6)
2.  Cancel the zero pairs in the following two sets of tokens. On what 

floor is the lift attendant in each case? What is the corresponding 
addition statement in each case?

a. b. 

Using tokens for subtraction
We have seen how to perform addition of integers with positive 
tokens and negative tokens. We can also perform subtraction using 
tokens!

Example: Let us subtract:  
(+5) – (+4).

This is easy to do. From 5 positives (+ 5) – (+ 4) = + 1
take away 4 positives to see the result.

Example: Let us subtract:  
(–7) – (–5).

Is (– 7) – (– 5) the same as (– 7) + (+ 5)? (–7) – (–5) = –2

Example: Let us subtract: (+ 5) – (+ 6).
Put down 5 positives.
But there are not enough tokens to take out 6 positives!

257

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   257 13-08-2024   17:32:24



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

To get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a 
positive and a negative), knowing that this does not change the value 
of the set of tokens.

Now, we can take out 6 positives! 
See what is left:

We conclude that (+5) – (+6) = – 1.

 Figure it Out
 1. Evaluate the following differences using tokens. Check that you 

get the same result as with other methods you now know:
a. (+ 10) – (+ 7) b. (– 8) – (– 4) c. (– 9) – (– 4) 
d. (+ 9) – (+ 12) e. (– 5) – (– 7) f. (– 2) – (– 6)

2. Complete the subtractions: 
a. (– 5) – (– 7) b. (+ 10) – (+ 13) c. (– 7) – (– 9) 
d. (+ 3) – (+ 8) e. (– 2) – (– 7) f. (+ 3) – (+ 15) 

Example: + 4 –  (– 6).
Start with 4 positives.
We have to take out 6 negatives from these. But there are not 

enough negatives.
This is not a problem. We add some zero pairs as this does not 

change the value of the set of tokens. 
But how many zero pairs? We have to take away 6 negatives so 

we put down 6 zero pairs: 

Now we can take away 6 negatives:

 Therefore, + 4 – (– 6) = + 10.

10.3 Integers in Other Places
Credits and debits
Suppose you open a bank account at your local bank with the `100 
that you had been saving over the last month. Your bank balance 
therefore, starts at `100. 

Then you make `60 at your job the next day and you deposit it in 
your account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a ‘credit’. 

 Your new bank balance is _______. 

  The next day you pay your electric bill of `30 using your bank 
account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a ‘debit’.

 Your bank balance is now ______.

  The next day you make a major purchase for your business of 
`150. Again this is shown as a debit. 

 What is your bank balance now? ______ 

 Is this possible?

Yes, some banks do allow your account balance to become negative, 
temporarily! Some banks also charge you an additional amount if 
your balance becomes negative, in the form of ‘interest’ or a ‘fee’.

Your strategic large purchase the previous day allows you to 
make, `200 at your business the next day.

 What is your balance now? ______
You can think of ‘credits’ as positive numbers and ‘debits’ as negative 
numbers. The total of all your credits (positive numbers) and debits 
(negative numbers) is your total bank account balance. This can be 
positive or negative!

In general, it is better to try to keep a positive balance in your 
bank account! 

 Figure it Out

1. Suppose you start with `0 in your bank account, and then you 
have credits of `30, `40, and `50, and debits of `40, `50, and `60. 
What is your bank account balance now?

2. Suppose you start with ̀ 0 in your bank account, and then you have 
debits of `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128, and then a single credit of 
`256. What is your bank account balance now?

3. Why is it generally better to try and maintain a positive balance in 
your bank account? What are circumstances under which it may 
be worthwhile to temporarily  have a negative balance?

As you can see, positive and negative numbers along with zero are 
extremely useful in the world of banking and accounting.

Geographical cross sections
We measure the height of geographical features like mountains, 
plateaus, and deserts from ‘sea level’. The height at sea level is 0m. 
Heights above sea level are represented using positive numbers and 
heights below sea level are represented using negative numbers.

Teacher’s note 
Ask what a geographical cross section is by showing the figure in this 
page. It is like imagining a vertical slice taken out at some location on 
the Earth. This is what would be seen from a side view. Discuss the 
notion of ‘sea level’ for measuring heights and depths in geography.

2. Which is the highest point in this geographical cross section? 
Which is the lowest point?

3. Can you write the points A, B, …, G in a sequence of decreasing order 
of heights? Can you write the points in a sequence of increasing 
order of heights?

4. What is the highest point above sea level on Earth? What is its 
height?

5. What is the lowest point with respect to sea level on land or on the 
ocean floor? What is its height? (This height should be negative).

Temperature
During summer time you would have heard in the news that there 
is a ‘heat wave’. What do you think will be the temperature during 
the summer when you feel very hot? In the winter we have cooler 
or colder temperatures.

What has been the maximum temperature during the summer 
and the minimum temperature during the winter last year in your 
area? Find out.

When we measure temperature, we use Celsius as the unit of 
measure (°C). The thermometers below are showing 40°C and 15°C 
temperatures.

Teacher’s note 
Talk about thermometers and how they are used to measure 
temperature. Bring a laboratory thermometer to the class and 
measure the temperature of hot water and cold water. Point out to 
children that there are markings in the thermometer that are below 
0°C. Have a discussion on what 0°C indicates, namely, the freezing 
point of water. 

10.4 Explorations with Integers
A hollow integer grid

4 – 1 – 3 5 – 3 – 5

– 3 1 0 – 5

– 1 – 1 2 – 8 – 2 7

There is something special about the numbers in these two grids. 
Let us explore what that is.

Top row:  4 + (– 1) + (– 3)  = 0  5 + (– 3) + (– 5)  = ____
Bottom row: (– 1) + (– 1) +   2     = 0 (– 8) + (– 2) +   7     = ____
Left column:  4 + (– 3) + (– 1)  = 0  5 +    0    + (– 8)  = ____
Right column: (– 3) +   1     +   2    = 0 (– 5) + (– 5)  +   7     = ____

In each grid, the numbers in each of the two rows (the top row 
and the bottom row) and the numbers in each of the two columns 
(the leftmost column and the rightmost column) add up to give the 
same number. We shall call this sum as the ‘border sum’. The border 
sum of the first grid is ‘0’.

 Figure it Out
1. Do the calculations for the second grid above and find the 

border sum.

Border sum is +4 Border sum is – 2 Border sum is – 4

3. For the last grid above, find more than one way of filling the 
numbers to get border sum – 4.

4. Which other grids can be filled in multiple ways? What could be 
the reason?

5.  Make a border integer square puzzle and challenge your classmates.

An amazing grid of numbers!
Below is a grid having some numbers. Follow the steps as shown 
until no number is left.

10.5 A Pinch of History
Like general fractions, general integers (including zero and the 
negative numbers) were first conceived of and used in Asia, thousands 
of years ago, before they eventually spread across the world in more 
modern times.

The first known instances of the use of negative numbers 
occurred in the context of accounting. In one of China’s most 
important mathematical works, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical 
Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu)—which was completed by the first or second 
century CE—positive and negative numbers were represented using 
red and black rods, much like the way we represented them using 
red and black tokens!

266

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   266 13-08-2024   17:32:41



The Other Side of Zero

There was a strong culture of accountancy also in India in ancient 
times. The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively 
by Kautilya in his Arthaśhāstra (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition 
that an account balance could be negative. The explicit use of negative 
numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient 
Indian works, including in the Bakśhālī manuscript from around the 
year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special 
symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as 
we do today).

The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, 
and zero — all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on 
which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and even division — was given by Brahmagupta in 
his Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave 
clear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers — positive, 
negative, and zero — that essentially formed the modern way of 
understanding these numbers that we still use today!

Some of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of 
positive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below:

Brahmagupta’s Rules for Addition (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta 
18.30, 628 CE)

1. The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). 
2. The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add 

the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to 
obtain the result (e.g., (– 2) + (– 3) = – 5).

3. To add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the 
smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number 
(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to 
obtain the result (e.g., –  5 + 3 = – 2,  2 + (– 3) = – 1 and – 3 + 5 = 2).

4. The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0). 
5. The sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 

= – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0).

267

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd   267 13-08-2024   17:32:41



Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Brahmagupta’s Rules for Subtraction (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta 
18.31-18.32)

1. If a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result 
is positive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1). 

2. If a larger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result 
is negative (e.g., 2– 3 = – 1).

3. Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the 
corresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – (– 3) = 2 + 3).

4. Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and – 2 – 
(– 2) = 0).

5. Subtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2 
– 0 = – 2 and 0 –  0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the 
number’s inverse (e.g., 0 –  (– 2) = 2).

Once you understand Brahmagupta’s rules, you can do addition 
and subtraction with any numbers whatsoever — positive, negative, 
and zero!

  Figure it Out
1. Can you explain each of Brahmagupta’s rules in terms of Bela’s 

Building of Fun, or in terms of a number line? 
2. Give your own examples of each rule.

Brahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on 
an equal footing with positive numbers as well as with negative 
numbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic 
operations on all such numbers, positive, negative, and zero—forming 
what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does 
mathematics.

However, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to 
adopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers 
were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab 
world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the 
13th century. 

268

The Other Side of Zero

Surprisingly, negative numbers were still not accepted by many 
European mathematicians even in the 18th century. Lazare Carnot, a 
French mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers 
‘absurd’.  But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved 
to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are 
now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with 
and as important as positive numbers — just as Brahmagupta had 
recommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE! 
This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way 
for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about 
in future classes.

Summary
 There are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ‘–’ 

sign in front of them (e.g., – 2), and are called negative numbers. They 
lie to the left of zero on the number line.

 The numbers ..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called integers. The 
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers  and the numbers …, 
– 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive 
nor negative.

 Every given number has another number associated to it which when 
added to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive 
inverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and 
the additive inverse of – 543 is 543.

 Addition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target 
Position.

 Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or 
increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement.

 Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position – Starting Position 
= Movement.

 In general, we can add two numbers by following Brahmagupta’s Rules 
for Addition:
a. If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a 

positive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).
b. If both numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs), 

and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (– 2 + (– 3) = – 5).
c. If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the 

smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number 
(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to 
obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2).

d. A number plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0).
e. A number plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2).

 We can subtract two integers by converting the problem into an addition 
problem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an 
integer is the same as the addition of its additive inverse. 

 Integers can be compared: … – 3 < – 2 < – 1 < 0 < +1 < +2 < +3 < ... Smaller 
numbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line.

 We can give meaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting 
them as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers 
as distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly, 
negative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground 
level. When measuring temperatures in degrees Celsius, positive 
temperatures are those above the freezing point of water, and negative 
temperatures are those below the freezing point of water.

Rules
• This is a two player game. Each player has 1 pawn. Both 

players start at 0. Players can reach either – 50 or + 50 to win 
but need not decide or fix this before or during play.

• Each player rolls two dice at a time. One dice has numbers 
from + 1 to + 6 and the other dice has numbers from – 1 to – 6. 

• After each roll of the two dice, the player can add or subtract 
them in any order and then move the steps that indicate the 
result. A positive result means moving towards + 50 and a 
negative result means moving towards – 50.
